Access to early diagnosis and effective treatment of all malaria patients will minimize mortality. The guiding principles of treatment during epidemics are as follows:<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>to reduce onward transmission:&#13;\n\t<ul><li>use a drug that is gametocidal;<\/li>&#13;\n\t\t<li>use MDA with a long-acting drug, if feasible, to reduce transmission, with good acceptability and compliance and high coverage &gt; 80%. MDA should only be used under certain conditions (see the WHO recommendations and mass drug administration field manual <em> <a href=\"\/node\/455\">(23)<\/a><\/em>).<\/li>&#13;\n\t\t<li>use radical cure with primaquine (14-day regimen) in epidemics due to <em>P. vivax.<\/em><\/li>&#13;\n\t<\/ul><\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>to reduce mortality:&#13;\n\t<ul><li>consider mass fever treatment if MDA is not appropriate;<\/li>&#13;\n\t\t<li>if the epidemic occurs in a remote area with poor access to health care, establish new or temporary health posts (mobile clinics);<\/li>&#13;\n\t\t<li>ensure early management of severe cases either at peripheral level (early pre-referral or full treatment) or in referral health facilities; and<\/li>&#13;\n\t\t<li>in epidemics in complex emergency situations, malnutrition and other co-morbid conditions should be managed during malaria case management.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<\/ul><\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><p>For early vector control, target adult mosquitoes to reduce transmission.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>\u00a0Operationally, vector control options are viable if epidemic-prone districts are well prepared\u00a0 \u00a0and emergency stocks are pre-disposed and maintained.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>\u00a0Biologically, they are feasible when implemented at an early stage of an epidemic.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>\u00a0IRS is feasible when well conducted, with &gt; 85% coverage rate, and the vector rests\u00a0 \u00a0indoors. IRS can be conducted within 2 weeks of epidemic onset. Similarly, use of ITNs is\u00a0 \u00a0feasible but requires prior behavioural change in the community and impact is less\u00a0 \u00a0immediate than IRS.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>\u00a0In complex emergency situations, where refugee camps can be established, use of ITNs\u00a0 \u00a0and IRS in available structures are highly effective. In some situations, larval habitats are\u00a0 \u00a0readily identified, and appropriate larval source reduction can be used.<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><p>Malaria epidemics may affect several countries or territories within a country at the same time.
