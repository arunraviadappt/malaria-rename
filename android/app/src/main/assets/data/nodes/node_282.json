{"body":"<p>Local cases can be introduced or indigenous. It may be difficult to distinguish between these categories; however, this is not important in the early stages of malaria elimination, because all such cases indicate the presence of recent local transmission. The distinction becomes important during the interval just before certification of malaria-free status, when the occurrence of some introduced cases (rigorously validated) is not an impediment to certification (see <a href=\"\/node\/337\"><strong>section 5<\/strong><\/a>).<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>An \u201cintroduced\u201d case occurs at a biologically plausible spatial and temporal distance from an observed imported case. As noted above, investigation of an imported case may result in identification of cases that were probably introduced. This indicates local transmission, and further activities to stop transmission should be instituted, including evaluating vector control activities and ACD.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>An \u201cindigenous\u201d case is one that was probably derived from locally transmitted cases, with no evidence that it was imported or linked directly to an imported case. Such cases indicate ongoing local transmission, and further work to stop transmission should be instituted (see above).<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul>","title":"2.6.3.2 Local cases","nid":282,"vid":2811,"created":1567145647,"changed":1581932610,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":27,"name":"Surveillance of elimination"}]}
