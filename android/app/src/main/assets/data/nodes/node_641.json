{"body":"<p>Malaria elimination is more likely to be sustained where vectorial capacity is naturally low or is decreased by improving socio-economic factors and in geographically isolated areas with limited cross-border population movement and importation of parasites. Therefore, preventing the re-establishment of malaria transmission relies on proper management of receptivity and vulnerability. \u201cReceptivity\u201d is defined as the ability of an ecosystem to allow transmission of malaria, while \u201cvulnerability\u201d refers to the probability that malaria parasites will be imported into a country or area (see also <a href=\"\/node\/250\"><strong>section 2<\/strong><\/a>).<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"4.1 Risks for re-establishment of malaria","nid":641,"vid":3567,"created":1578304633,"changed":1588225937,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_operational_":[{"field_image":"","field_link":"","field_title":null}],"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":40,"name":"Prevention of re-establishment"}]}
