{"body":"<p>Such cases may be imported or locally acquired. A relapsing or recrudescent case that was originally imported should be classified as an imported case.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>In elimination settings, a person infected locally before transmission was interrupted could have a relapse or a late primary attack of <em>P. vivax<\/em> or <em>P. ovale<\/em> malaria. A relapsing case requires radical cure according to national standards, which usually includes an anti-malarial drug for the asexual stage (chloroquine or ACT) and primaquine (after evaluation for G6PD deficiency) at a dose of 0.25\u20130.5 mg\/kg body weight daily for 14 days <a href=\"\/node\/364\"><em>(8)<\/em><\/a>. Further investigations can be undertaken in the case household and neighbourhood, as for imported cases.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>A locally acquired malaria case may be detected after transmission has been interrupted, because of long latency in the blood. Such cases have been described for <em>P. malariae<\/em> and, exceptionally, for <em>P. falciparum <\/em>malaria. If careful investigation of such a case provides strong evidence that it was indeed acquired locally by mosquito infection before the presumed interruption of transmission, it may be classified as \u201crecrudescent\u201d, and its occurrence should not preclude certification. Recrudescent cases should be treated according to the national treatment guidelines.<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul>","title":"2.6.3.3 Relapsing or recrudescent cases","nid":283,"vid":2812,"created":1567145730,"changed":1581932690,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":27,"name":"Surveillance of elimination"}]}
