{"body":"<p>Infections with <em>P<\/em>. <em>ovale<\/em> (both species), <em>P.<\/em> <em>malariae<\/em> and <em>P.<\/em> <em>knowlesi<\/em> are considered to be generally sensitive to chloroquine. A single study in Indonesia reported resistance of <em>P<\/em>. <em>malariae<\/em> to chloroquine (27). The recommended treatment for radical cure of <em>P.<\/em> <em>ovale<\/em> relapsing malaria is the same as that for<em> P. vivax<\/em>, i.e. ACT or chloroquine combined with primaquine (total dose, 3.5 mg base\/kg bw). The high prevalence of G6PD deficiency in areas endemic for <em>P<\/em>. <em>ovale<\/em> indicates that caution should be exercised in use of primaquine, as stated below. <em>P<\/em>. <em>malariae<\/em> and <em>P. knowlesi<\/em> do not form hypnozoites and so do not require radical cure with primaquine.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"A6.3.3 Treatment of malaria caused by p. ovale, p. malariae and p. knowlesi","nid":154,"vid":1479,"created":1566388412,"changed":1573198302,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null}
