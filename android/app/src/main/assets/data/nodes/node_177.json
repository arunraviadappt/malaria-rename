Under the section on 'practical information', these recommendations have been summarized and slightly revised to clarify that these recommendations are not specific to LLINs, but apply to ITNs in general.<\/span><\/p>","practical_info":"<p>To achieve and maintain optimal ITN coverage, countries should apply a combination of mass free net distribution through campaigns and continuous distribution through multiple channels, in particular through ANC clinics and the EPI. Mass campaigns are the only proven cost-effective way to rapidly achieve high and equitable coverage. Complementary continuous distribution channels are also required because coverage gaps can start to appear almost immediately post-campaign due to net deterioration, loss of nets, and population growth.<br \/><br \/>Mass campaigns should distribute one ITN for every two persons at risk of malaria. However, for procurement purposes, the calculation to determine the number of ITNs required needs to be adjusted at the population level, since many households have an odd number of members. Therefore, a ratio of one ITN for every 1.8 persons in the target population should be used to estimate ITN requirements, unless data to inform a different quantification ratio are available. In places where the most recent population census is more than five years old, countries can consider including a buffer (e.g. adding 10% after the 1.8 ratio has been applied) or using data from previous ITN campaigns to justify an alternative buffer amount. Campaigns should also normally be repeated every three years, unless available empirical evidence justifies the use of a longer or shorter interval between campaigns. In addition to these data-driven decisions, a shorter distribution interval may be justified during humanitarian emergencies, as the resulting increase in population movement may leave populations uncovered by vector control and potentially increasing their risk of infection as well as the risk of epidemics.<br \/><br \/>Continuous distribution through ANC and EPI channels should remain functional before, during and after mass distribution campaigns. In determining the optimal mix of ITN delivery mechanisms to ensure optimal coverage and maximized efficiency, consideration should be given to the required number of nets, the cost per net distributed and coverage over time. For example, during mass distribution campaign years, other delivery schemes may need to be altered to avoid-over supply of ITNs.<br \/><br \/>\u2018Top-up\u2019 campaigns (i.e., ITN distributions that take into account existing nets in households and provide each household only with the additional number of nets needed to bring it up to the target number) are not recommended. Substantial field experience has shown that accurate quantification for such campaigns is generally not feasible and the cost of accounting for existing nets outweighs the benefits.<br \/><br \/>There should be a single national ITN plan and policy that includes both continuous and campaign distribution strategies. This should be developed and implemented under the leadership of the national malaria control programme, based on an analysis of local opportunities and constraints, and identification of a combination of distribution channels with which to achieve optimal coverage and minimize gaps. This unified plan should include a comprehensive net quantification and gap analysis for all public sector ITN distribution channels. As much as possible, the plan should\u00a0<s> <\/s>include major ITN contributions by the private sector.<br \/><br \/>Therefore, in addition to mass campaigns, the distribution strategy could include:<\/p><ul><li>ANC, EPI and other child health clinics: These should be considered high-priority continuous ITN distribution channels in countries where these services are used by a large proportion of the population at risk of malaria, as occurs in much of sub-Saharan Africa.<\/li><li>Schools, faith- and community-based networks, and agricultural and food-security support schemes: These can also be explored as channels for ITN distribution in countries where such approaches are feasible and equitable. Investigating the potential use of these distribution channels in complex emergencies is particularly important.<\/li><li>Occupation-related distribution channels: In some settings, particularly in Asia, the risk of malaria may be strongly associated with specific occupations (e.g., plantation and farm workers and their families, miners, soldiers and forest workers). In these settings, opportunities for distribution through channels such as private sector employers, workplace programmes and farmers\u2019 organizations may be explored.<\/li><li>Private or commercial sector channels: These can be important channels for supplementing free ITN distribution through public sector channels. Access to ITNs can also be expanded by facilitating the exchange of vouchers or coupons provided through public sector channels for a free or subsidized ITN at participating retail outlets. ITN products distributed through the private sector should be regulated by the national registrar of pesticides in order to ensure that product quality is in line with WHO recommendations.<\/li><\/ul><p><br \/>The procurement of ITNs with attributes that are more costly (e.g., nets of conical shape) is not recommended for countries in sub-Saharan Africa, unless nationally representative data clearly show that the use of ITNs with particular attributes increases significantly among populations at risk of malaria. To build an evidence base to support the purchase of more costly nets, investigation into the preferences and into whether meeting preferences translates into increased use of ITNs may also be warranted, particularly in situations where standard nets are unlikely to suit the lifestyle of specific population groups at risk of malaria, such as may be the case for nomadic populations.<br \/><br \/>The lifespans of ITNs can vary widely among individual nets used within a single household or community, as well as among nets used in different settings. This makes it difficult to plan the rate or frequency at which replacement nets need to be procured and delivered. All malaria programmes that have undertaken medium- to large-scale ITN distributions should conduct ITN durability monitoring in line with available guidance to inform appropriate replacement intervals. Where there is evidence that ITNs are not being adequately cared for or used, programmes should design and implement BCC activities aimed at improving these behaviours.<br \/><br \/>In countries where untreated nets are widely available, national malaria control programmes should promote access to ITNs. Strategies for treating untreated nets can also be considered, for example, by supporting access to insecticide treatment kits.<br \/><br \/>As national malaria control programmes implement different mixes of distribution methods in different geographic areas, there will be a need to accurately track ITN coverage at subnational levels. Subnational responses should be triggered if coverage falls below programmatic targets. Tracking should differentiate among the contributions of various delivery channels to overall ITN coverage.<br \/><br \/>Countries should generate data on defined standard indicators of coverage and access rates in order to ascertain whether optimal coverage has been achieved and maintained. The data should also inform changes in implementation in order to improve performance and progress towards the achievement of programmatic targets. Currently, the three basic survey indicators are: i) the proportion of households with at least one ITN; ii) the proportion of the population with access to an ITN within their household; and iii) the proportion of the population reporting having slept under an ITN the previous night (by age [<5 years; 5\u201314 years; 15+ years], gender and access to ITN).<\/p>","field_icon":null},{"field_title":"Management of old ITNs (2019)\u00a0","field_content":"<p><strong>Management of old ITNs (2019)\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p>WHO recommends that old ITNs should only be collected where there is assurance that: i) communities are not left without nets, i.e., new ITNs are distributed to replace old ones; and ii) there is a suitable and sustainable plan in place for safe disposal of the collected material.\u00a0<\/p><p>If ITNs and their packaging (bags and baling materials) are collected, the best option for disposal is high-temperature incineration.

If such strategies are employed, the selection of the specific intervention(s) should be highly contextual, i.e., it should take into account the specific environment the type of intervention(s) that are relevant to that environment, the resources needed and their availability, the feasibility of the intervention(s), their acceptability by local stakeholders and how they might impact equity. The selection should also take into account previous experience either gained locally or from other areas of similar ecological and epidemiological characteristics where such intervention(s) have been implemented. Additionally, the selection of the comparator should consider other interventions that are known to be cost-effective, for example, larviciding. Where the decision is taken to invest resources into larval habitat modification and\/or larval habitat manipulation, the intervention(s) should be designed and conducted with the explicit aim of generating data to demonstrate effective malaria control and preferably, supported with environmental and entomological data as secondary end-points.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>When assessing the impact of environmental management against malaria, it is important that the testing of the intervention(s) being investigated is\/are specifically conducted for the purpose of preventing or controlling malaria by reducing the availability and productivity of larval habitats. For example, dams are generally constructed for water management, irrigation or power production purposes, not for malaria control. In fact, in some cases, their construction may result in increased larval production due to the creation of standing water bodies. The controlled release of water from the impoundment of a dam, however, is considered an example of habitat manipulation, a recurrent activity which potentially controls mosquito larvae by increasing the flow rate of downstream water with the aim of preventing mosquito \u00a0development and so controlling malaria transmission. This is one example of the multitude of interventions that fall under the broad category of habitat modification and\/or manipulation. To be able to generate evidence on the efficacy of larval habitat modification and\/or manipulation in preventing malaria, and to facilitate the interpretation of the evidence once generated, it is important to well define the interventions that are being evaluated and, importantly, compare how the water conditions of larval habitats at the intervention and control sites are affected. For example, if the intervention aimed to increase the water flow of downstream areas, the evaluation \u00a0should include an assessment of \u00a0whether this was achieved, as well as to what extent this impacted the development of the immature and adult stages of the mosquito and, ultimately, whether there was an epidemiological impact on against malaria in the intervention arms compared to control areas. This information will then support the evolution of WHO guidance in this area and, ultimately, guide the choice and implementation of efficacious interventions.<\/p>","field_icon":null},{"field_title":"Larvivorous fish (2019)","field_content":"<p><strong>Larvivorous fish (2019)<\/strong><br><br>No recommendation can be made because no evidence on the effectiveness of larvivorous fish for the prevention and control of malaria was identified.<\/p>","justification":"<p><span style=\"background-color:rgb( 255 , 255 , 255 )\">The systematic review conducted in 2017 on use of larvivorous fish\u00a0<\/span><cite class=\"magic-cite\" data-ref-id=\"362680\" data-label=\"\">[61]<\/cite><span style=\"background-color:rgb( 255 , 255 , 255 )\">\u00a0did not identify any studies demonstrating \u00a0impact on malaria and so there is insufficient evidence to support a recommendation.

The lack of data from RCTs, other trial designs or quasi-experimental studies has therefore hampered a comprehensive assessment of this intervention and the review concluded that it is unknown whether space spraying causes a reduction in incidence of malaria. Anticipated desirable effects of space spraying are likely to be small, as insecticide formulations used are short-lived. <i>Anopheles<\/i> mosquitoes are generally considered to be less susceptible to space spraying than <i>Culex <\/i>or <i>Aedes<\/i>. Space spraying is frequently applied when cases are at their peak, which is followed by a decline in cases, whether or not control measures are applied. Nevertheless, space spraying is often deployed in response to outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease. Due to the high visibility of this intervention, the decision to use this approach is usually made to demonstrate that the authorities are taking action in response to the outbreak. This practice should be strongly discouraged given the limited evidence of the intervention\u2019s effectiveness, the high cost and the potential for wastage of resources.
