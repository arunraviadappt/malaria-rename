{"body":"<p>This sector comprises a wide range of health care providers: medical practitioners, licensed pharmacies, unlicensed drug vendors, authorized services for the employees of private companies and not-for-profit services, such as nongovernmental organizations and faith-based organizations. Depending on national policies and regulations, all may be involved in malaria diagnosis, treatment and surveillance. Their engagement requires that the public sector invest in communication, training, monitoring and, in many cases, provision of quality-assured diagnostics and medicines. The not-for-profit private sector often provides high-quality services. The informal private sector, however, may be a major source of irrational treatment, substandard medicines and under- or no reporting of malaria cases. When elimination targets are set, the informal private sector may require specific attention. Each country should develop a strategy for determining the most appropriate role for various types of private providers.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"2.4.3.2 The private health sector","nid":271,"vid":372,"created":1567143713,"changed":1567143734,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null}
