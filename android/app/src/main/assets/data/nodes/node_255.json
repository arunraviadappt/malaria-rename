{"body":"<p>High coverage of ITN\/LLIN can be achieved and maintained most rapidly by a combination of mass free-distribution campaigns and continuous distribution channels <em><a href=\"\/node\/364\">(19)<\/a><\/em>. Distribution campaigns with a target of one net for every two people or one net for every sleeping space can rapidly achieve high coverage. As many households have an odd number of occupants, an overall ratio of 1 ITN\/LLIN for every 1.8 people in the targeted population should be used to calculate overall ITN\/LLIN procurement <em><a href=\"\/node\/364\">(20)<\/a><\/em>. The frequency of mass campaigns should be decided on the basis of net durability, and only WHO-recommended ITNs\/LLINs should be procured and distributed. Programmes should consider maintaining stocks of ITNs\/LLINs for local replacement, which requires a modest additional number of ITNs\/LLINs over that calculated for the campaign and continuous distribution schemes.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Continuous or routine distribution channels include: antenatal, child health and vaccination services; schools, places of worship and community networks; work sites (e.g. plantations, military facilities, mines and farms) and the private or commercial health sector.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"2.3.1.1 ITNs\/LLINs","nid":255,"vid":2738,"created":1567084838,"changed":1580284893,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":44,"name":"Strategy & interventions of malaria elimination"}]}
