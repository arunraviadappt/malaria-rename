A 3-day course of the artemisinin component of ACTs covers two asexual cycles, ensuring that only a small fraction of parasites remain for clearance by the partner drug, thus reducing the potential development of resistance to the partner drug. Shorter courses (1\u20132 days) are therefore not recommended, as they are less effective, have less effect on gametocytes and provide less protection for the slowly eliminated partner drug.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Rationale for the recommendation:<\/strong><br \/>\nThe Guideline Development Group considers that 3 days of an artemisinin derivative are necessary to provide sufficient efficacy, promote good adherence and minimize the risk for drug resistance due to incomplete treatment.<\/span><\/p>\n","practical_info":null,"field_icon":null}],"field_header":"Treating uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria&nbsp;(2015)"}],"field_content_type":{"tid":9,"name":"Accord","class":"accord"},"field_left_right_navigation":1,"field_operational_":[{"field_image":"","field_link":"","field_title":null}],"field_recommendations":1,"recommendation":"<p>All cases of suspected malaria should have a parasitological test (microscopy or Rapid diagnostic test (RDT)) to confirm the diagnosis.<br \/>\r\nBoth microscopy and RDTs should be supported by a quality assurance programme.<br \/>\r\n<font color=\"#4090CF\"><em>Good practice statement<\/em><\/font><\/p>\r\n","recommendation_title":"Rapid diagnostic test (RDT)","field_recommendation_api_url":"https:\/\/api.magicapp.org\/api\/v1\/recommendations\/?sectionId=78098","field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":66,"name":"Recommendations for case management"},{"tid":47,"name":"Uncomplicated malaria"}]}
