{"body":"<p>Strategic planning is \u201cowned\u201d by the national malaria programme and supported by stakeholders and partners. Strategic plans should be costed to inform and facilitate resource mobilization. Although the aim of all programmes is ultimately to obtain malaria-free status, the time-bound nature of a strategic plan may indicate a different goal, such as reducing the prevalence of malaria below a certain threshold. Different goals may be set for subnational regions with different contexts, such as a highly endemic province or district or one in which malaria transmission is low.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Elimination plans should define the objectives to be achieved along the path to the goal. The objectives may be epidemiological, operational or financial. For each objective, the activities or actions required should then be included in an operational plan, and indicators for assessing progress should be defined in a monitoring and evaluation plan.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"3.1.1 Strategic planning","nid":298,"vid":2830,"created":1567147848,"changed":1581943539,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":44,"name":"Strategy & interventions of malaria elimination"}]}
