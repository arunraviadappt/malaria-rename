{"body":"<p>The cost, budgeting, financial management and cost\u2013effectiveness of prevention and treatment tools and strategies when the goal is elimination depend on the context and are often poorly understood. For example, surveillance strategies for finding and eliminating the asymptomatic parasite reservoir can vary from population-wide strategies to targeted case and focus investigation; and the cost and cost\u2013effectiveness of each approach depends on the size and spatial distribution of programme activities. The cost\u2013effectiveness of (novel) vector control measures also depends on the context. As costs may change dramatically after elimination but not be fully documented in advance, studies of the cost\u2013effectiveness of a package of elimination interventions are fundamentally different from those of control scenarios, as they require assumptions of costs and cost reductions after elimination.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"6.2.3 Cost and economic measures","nid":360,"vid":815,"created":1567506561,"changed":1568375388,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null}
