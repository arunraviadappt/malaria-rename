There must be strict adherence to the study protocol to ensure data quality.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>When drug efficacy monitoring is fully integrated into surveillance activities, the funding, including for recommended activities such as analysis of molecular markers, should be part of the overall surveillance budget. Sufficient funding and human resources must be allocated to both the collection and analysis of data and supervision of the overall system.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"4.4.3 Budgeting for monitoring antimalarial efficacy","nid":408,"vid":2639,"created":1567598812,"changed":1578670552,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":42,"name":"Drug efficacy & resistance"}]}
