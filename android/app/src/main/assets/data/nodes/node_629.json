{"body":"<p>TES are prospective evaluations of patients\u2019 clinical and parasitological responses to treatment for uncomplicated malaria. Studies conducted according to the WHO protocol <em><a href=\"\/node\/455\">(27)<\/a><\/em>, repeatedly at the same sites and at regular intervals, allow early detection of changes in treatment efficacy and comparison of results within and across regions over time.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Resistance to antimalarial drugs (except for partial resistance to artemisinins) is defined by WHO as the ability of a parasite strain to survive or multiply (or both) despite administration and absorption of a drug given in doses equal to or higher than those usually recommended, but within the tolerance of the patient. Treatment failure is defined as the inability to clear malarial parasitaemia or prevent recrudescence after administration of a therapeutic regime of a recommended antimalarial medicine, regardless of whether clinical symptoms are resolved. Drug resistance is only one of several factors that may cause treatment failure. Although a TES can help to predict the likelihood of resistance to an antimalarial drug, confirmation and characterization of parasite resistance require additional tools (e.g. in-vitro or ex-vivo tests, analysis of molecular markers and measurement of drug concentrations in the blood), for which WHO standard protocols are available <em><a href=\"\/node\/455\">(27)<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n","title":"Introduction","nid":629,"vid":2629,"created":1576661655,"changed":1578668694,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_operational_":[{"field_image":"","field_link":"","field_title":null}],"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":42,"name":"Drug efficacy & resistance"}]}
