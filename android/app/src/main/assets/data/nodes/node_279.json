{"body":"<p>Surveillance was recognized as an intervention for malaria eradication in and of itself in the initial Global Malaria Eradication Programme. In elimination settings, malaria surveillance comprises a set of responses that should allow (i) detection of all malaria infections (symptomatic and asymptomatic) as early as possible; (ii) prevention of onward transmission from each case through rapid, radical treatment and vector control; and (iii) identification, investigation, classification and management of all transmission foci with appropriate measures to terminate transmission as soon as possible.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The key activities of elimination surveillance systems are:<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>ensuring that an entire area (national or subnational) targeted for elimination is covered, with particular attention to areas with on-going or recent transmission;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>quality-assured diagnostic testing;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>testing of all cases of suspected malaria, reporting of all confirmed cases, investigation of all cases and foci and recording of all tests and investigations;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>case detection activities to:&#13;\n\t<ul><li>ensure rapid, complete treatment for parasite clearance in as many cases as possible to minimize the time during which cases can infect vectors; and<\/li>&#13;\n\t\t<li>provide information to monitor the programme\u2019s progress;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<\/ul><\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>following standard operating procedures for all components of surveillance and monitoring compliance in real time; and<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>participation of all health care providers treating malaria cases in the surveillance system.<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><p>For malaria elimination programmes to use surveillance as an intervention, there are certain requirements.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>There are sufficiently few cases and an adequate health staff to characterize, classify and follow up each one; the manageable number is likely to be two or three or fewer cases of confirmed malaria per health centre per week but will vary by location and the available staff.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>Cases have become clustered such that it is possible to identify and characterize discrete foci of transmission.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>The surveillance system covers cases detected by all health providers.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>Malaria is a notifiable disease by national legal requirements.<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><p>After interruption of transmission, surveillance for malaria may become part of the broad responsibility of the general health services; however, it should be supported by regular training and monitoring activities in a national programme to ensure the surveillance of changes in receptivity and vulnerability.
