{"body":"<p>Up-to-date, good-quality data on the efficacy of the recommended malaria treatment ensure that patients are cured and progress is made towards malaria elimination. As countries progress to very low numbers of indigenous malaria cases, monitoring of drug efficacy should be integrated into national malaria case surveillance, replacing regular studies of therapeutic efficacy. Once efficacy monitoring has been integrated into overall case surveillance, treatment should be given to all patients (regardless of age and parasitaemia) under direct observation. At a minimum, the patient should be assessed clinically and parasitologically daily for the first three days and weekly thereafter (until day 28 or day 42 for ACT containing a partner drug with a long half-life). Integration of surveillance of drug efficacy into overall malaria case surveillance facilitates the collection of information on efficacy; complementary information on molecular markers of drug resistance is also useful.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"2.6.7 Monitoring drug efficacy","nid":292,"vid":2821,"created":1567146320,"changed":1581941502,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":27,"name":"Surveillance of elimination"}]}
