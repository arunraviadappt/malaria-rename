{"body":"<p>Many countries have well-established community case management services that provide diagnosis, treatment and reporting of clinical cases of malaria free of charge. Technically, community service providers are part of public services, but the providers themselves are often volunteers, who depend on support from health workers in peripheral health facilities, their community or nongovernmental organizations. In some countries, community workers receive regular remuneration. Because community services are often the best solution for people living in remote areas, countries should consider how to ensure high-quality community outreach that includes testing and treatment for malaria.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The quality of care relies on appropriate diagnosis, treatment and counselling of patients and carers, applied with clear protocols and monitoring systems. The administration of medicines under supervised treatment (sometimes referred to as directly observed treatment, or DOT) may improve patient adherence to treatment and allows close patient monitoring during treatment. Until more evidence is available, programmes should apply the supervised treatment that is most appropriate to their context.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Strategies and treatment guidelines for <em>P. falciparum and P. vivax<\/em> malaria are described in <a href=\"\/node\/368\"><strong>Annex 2.<\/strong><\/a><\/p>&#13;\n","title":"2.4.3.3 Community services","nid":272,"vid":1287,"created":1567143750,"changed":1571917322,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null}
