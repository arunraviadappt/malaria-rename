{"body":"<p>Cases can be detected by passive case detection (PCD), when patients seek care for their illness from health workers; active case detection (ACD), which requires extension of testing with or without screening to high-risk, vulnerable groups, hardto-reach populations or low-transmission settings; and reactive case detection (RCD), which involves an active response to a case detected by either PCD or ACD. Testing should be conducted with a high-quality diagnostic test and the case reported after confirmation. When people are screened for symptoms before testing, cases are suspected when they occur in people with fever or a recent history of fever, a history of malaria, anaemia of unknown cause or splenomegaly. In areas with low, very low orno transmission, a history of travel to an endemic area is a strong criterion for testing.
