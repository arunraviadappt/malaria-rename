Lower total doses are not recommended, as these encourage the emergence of resistance. Chloroquine is given at an initial dose of 10 mg base\/kg bw, followed by 10 mg\/kg bw on the second day and 5 mg\/kg bw on the third day. In the past, the initial 10-mg\/kg bw dose was followed by 5 mg\/kg bw at 6 h, 24 h and 48 h. As residual chloroquine suppresses the first relapse of tropical <em>P. vivax <\/em>(which emerges about 3 weeks after onset of the primary illness), relapses begin to occur 5\u20137 weeks after treatment if radical curative treatment with primaquine is not given.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">ACTs are highly effective in the treatment of vivax malaria, allowing simplification (unification) of malaria treatment; i.e. all malaria infections can be treated with an ACT. The exception is artesunate + SP, where resistance significantly compromises its efficacy. Although good efficacy of artesunate + SP was reported in one study in Afghanistan, in several other areas (such as South-East Asia) <em>P. vivax <\/em>has become resistant to SP more rapidly than <em>P. falciparum. <\/em>The initial response to all ACTs is rapid in vivax malaria, reflecting the high sensitivity to artemisinin derivatives, but, unless primaquine is given, relapses commonly follow. The subsequent recurrence patterns differ, reflecting the elimination kinetics of the partner drugs. Thus, recurrences, presumed to be relapses, occur earlier after artemether + lumefantrine than after dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine or artesunate + mefloquine because lumefantrine is eliminated more rapidly than either mefloquine or piperaquine. A similar temporal pattern of recurrence with each of the drugs is seen in the&nbsp;<em>P. vivax <\/em>infections that follow up to one third of acute falciparum malaria infections in South-East Asia.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>In areas with chloroquine-resistant <em>P. vivax<\/em><\/strong><br>\nACTs containing piperaquine, mefloquine or lumefantrine are the recommended treatment, although artesunate + amodiaquine may also be effective in some areas.<br>\n<br>\nIn the systematic review of ACTs for treating <em>P. vivax <\/em>malaria, dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine provided a longer prophylactic effect than ACTs with shorter half-lives (artemether + lumefantrine, artesunate + amodiaquine), with significantly fewer recurrent parasitaemias during 9 weeks of follow-up (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.40\u20130.82, three trials, 1066 participants). The half-life of mefloquine is similar to that of piperaquine, but use of dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine in <em>P. vivax <\/em>mono-infections has not been compared directly in trials with use of artesunate + mefloquine.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Uncomplicated&nbsp;<\/strong><strong><em>P. ovale<\/em><\/strong><strong>, <\/strong><strong><em>P.<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<strong><em>malariae<\/em><\/strong><strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>P. knowlesi malaria<\/em><\/strong><br>\nResistance of <em>P. ovale, P. malariae <\/em>and <em>P. knowlesi <\/em>to antimalarial drugs is not well characterized, and infections caused by these three species are generally considered to be sensitive to chloroquine.

The frequency and pattern of relapses varies geographically, with relapse rates generally ranging from 8% to 80%. Temperate long-latency <em>P. vivax <\/em>strains are still prevalent in many areas. Recent evidence suggests that, in endemic areas where people are inoculated frequently with <em>P. vivax<\/em>, a significant proportion of the population harbours dormant but \u201cactivatable\u201d hypnozoites. The exact mechanism of activation of dormant hypnozoites is unclear.

Thus, the radical curative efficacy of primaquine must be set against the prevalent relapse frequency and the likely burden of \u201cactivatable\u201d hypnozoites. Experimental studies on vivax malaria and the relapsing simian malaria <em>P. cynomolgi <\/em>suggest that the total dose of 8-aminoquinoline given is the main determinant of radical curative efficacy.

The prevalence of G6PD deficiency varies, but in tropical areas it is typically 3\u201335%; high frequencies are found only in areas where malaria is or has been endemic.

Primaquine generates reactive intermediate metabolites that are oxidant and cause variable haemolysis in G6PD-deficient individuals. It also causes methemoglobinaemia. The severity of haemolytic anaemia depends on the dose of primaquine and on the variant of the G6PD enzyme. Fortunately, primaquine is eliminated rapidly so haemolysis is self-limiting once the drug is stopped. In the absence of exposure to primaquine or another oxidant agent, G6PD deficiency rarely causes clinical manifestations so, many patients are unaware of their G6PD status.
