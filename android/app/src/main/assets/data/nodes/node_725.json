{"body":"<p>WHO\u2019s guideline development process for new vector control interventions relies on evidence from at least two well-designed and well-conducted studies with epidemiological endpoints to demonstrate the public health value of the intervention. If the initial two studies generate contradictory or inconsistent results or suffer from design limitations that preclude comprehensive assessment of an intervention\u2019s potential public health value, further trials with epidemiological endpoints may be required. As such, WHO encourages the use of appropriate study designs, including the generation of baseline data and appropriate follow-up times that consider the characteristics of the intervention and its intended deployment, expected durability\/residual efficacy and replacement intervals, and the epidemiology (e.g., pathogen transmission intensity) of the selected study site. WHO encourages studies to be conducted for durations that maximize the likelihood that the study objectives and targeted statistical power will be robustly achieved so as to strengthen the evidence used to inform deliberations by a GDG regarding a potential WHO recommendation. \u00a0Detailed descriptions of the setting, interventions deployed, and vector species targeted are required. Investigators are encouraged to share their study design and methodology with WHO prior to commencing the study in order to enable the VCAG to validate whether the data generated are likely to provide quality evidence to inform the development of a WHO recommendation. High research standards should be employed in conducting, analysing and reporting studies, ensuring that studies are adequately powered, and appropriate randomization methods and statistical analyses are used. WHO requires studies to be conducted in compliance with international ethical standards and good clinical and laboratory practices.
