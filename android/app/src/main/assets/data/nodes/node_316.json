{"body":"<p>It is recommended that an advisory committee be established to provide an external view of progress and gaps in a malaria elimination programme. The committee should be convened regularly to review epidemiological trends and operational progress. It should be clearly independent from the national malaria programme. It could comprise academics, health system experts, staff in other disease control programmes and representation from non-health sectors. Reports from the committee may be valuable documentation for eventual WHO certification. It should also be responsible for supporting audits of data to validate information and could play a role in verification of subnational elimination. Generic terms of reference for an independent national malaria elimination advisory committee are provided in <a href=\"\/node\/379\"><strong>Annex 10.<\/strong><\/a><\/p>&#13;\n","title":"3.5 Independent national malaria elimination advisory committee","nid":316,"vid":2843,"created":1567502489,"changed":1581944044,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":44,"name":"Strategy & interventions of malaria elimination"}]}
