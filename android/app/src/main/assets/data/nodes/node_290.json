{"body":"<p>In many programmes, it may be necessary to triangulate case detection data with information from other surveys. In the early stages, data from malaria indicator surveys, demographic and health surveys and multiple indicator cluster surveys may provide useful information on disease burden and intervention coverage. As the prevalence of malaria decreases, such surveys play a smaller role in assessing the burden of disease and infection.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The most important surveys or special assessments in the late stages of a programme may be those on operational factors, such as coverage of key prevention interventions, the quality and availability of diagnosis and understanding of how to identify and manage a suspected case and how to investigate a confirmed case.<sup>14<\/sup>\u00a0Where appropriate, population-level information on intervention coverage and use can be collected during the process of case and\/or foci investigation. Health facility surveys may be used to investigate the quality of diagnosis and treatment of malaria.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<div class=\"source\">\u00a0&#13;\n<div class=\"source-content\">&#13;\n<p>\u00b94\u00a0In some settings and in certain research projects, surveys have been conducted with highly sensitive diagnostic tests or serology in certain at-risk populations to obtain complementary information on infection clearance. Pending further evaluation, WHO does not currently recommend these approaches for evaluating elimination but, instead, stresses the quality and the sensitivity of the surveillance system for finding and responding to cases.<\/p>&#13;\n<\/div>&#13;\n<\/div>&#13;\n","title":"2.6.5 Special surveys","nid":290,"vid":2823,"created":1567146226,"changed":1581942383,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":27,"name":"Surveillance of elimination"}]}
