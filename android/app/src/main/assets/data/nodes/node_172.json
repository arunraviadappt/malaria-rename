{"body":"<p>Reports of treatment failure and decreased drug sensitivity have often provided an important first indication of more widespread resistance in an area. Although such evidence may be biased, it can be collected without much effort at peripheral health centres. Reports of treatment failure are particularly useful if accompanied by measurement of the level of the (slowly eliminated) antimalarial drug at the time of recurrent infection (to assess exposure) and storage of blood samples for molecular genotyping and, if possible, parasite culture. If such reports are standardized and registered, they can make a valuable contribution to national early-warning systems and facilitate cost-effective monitoring by national programmes (26).<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"A7.5.2 Reporting of treatment failures","nid":172,"vid":813,"created":1566390293,"changed":1568374821,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null}
