{"body":"<p>This section presents the prerequisites and process for WHO certification of national malaria elimination; it also describes the new concept of verifying subnational malaria elimination, a country-owned, step-wise process for documenting elimination of local transmission of malaria in a province, region, island or other subnational area. The latter undertaking is an option for large countries that have achieved interruption of local transmission in certain states, regions or provinces and will contribute to the detailed documentation required for WHO certification of national malaria elimination. Key points in the certification and verification of malaria elimination are listed in <strong>Box 7.<\/strong><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<div class=\"grayshade-content\">&#13;\n<p><strong>BOX 7.<\/strong><br \/><strong>Certification and verification of malaria elimination <\/strong><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>WHO certification of malaria elimination requires proof that:&#13;\n\t<ul><li>local malaria transmission by <em>Anopheles<\/em> mosquitoes has been fully interrupted, resulting in zero incidence of indigenous cases for at least the past three consecutive years, and<\/li>&#13;\n\t\t<li>an adequate surveillance and response system for preventing reestablishment of indigenous transmission is fully functional (in particular the curative and preventive services and the epidemiological service) throughout the territory of the country.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<\/ul><\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>Certification of malaria elimination involves:&#13;\n\t<ul><li>preparation by the requesting country of a national elimination report with supporting documentation;<\/li>&#13;\n\t\t<li>evaluation by an independent WHO Malaria Elimination Certification Panel (MECP) of the national elimination report and documentation, and<\/li>&#13;\n\t\t<li>submission by the MECP of a final report and recommendation to the WHO MPAC, which sends a summary report to the WHO GMP for submission to the WHO Director-General.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<\/ul><\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>Subnational verification of malaria elimination is an option for large countries that have achieved interruption of local transmission in certain parts of the country.
