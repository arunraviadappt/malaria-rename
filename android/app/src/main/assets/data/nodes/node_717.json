{"body":"<p>Since the first and second editions of the guidelines were issued in 2006 and 2010, respectively, WHO methods for preparing guidelines have continued to evolve. The\u00a0third edition of the\u00a0<em>Guidelines for the treatment of malaria\u00a0<\/em>was prepared in accordance with the updated WHO standard methods for guideline development\u00a0<a href=\"#1\"><em>[1]<\/em><\/a>. This involved planning, \u201cscoping\u201d and needs assessment, establishment of a guidelines development group, formulation of key questions (PICO questions: population, participants or patients; intervention or indicator; comparator or control; outcome), commissioning reviews, Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and making recommendations. This method ensures a transparent link between the evidence and the recommendations. The GRADE system is a uniform, widely adopted approach based on explicit methods for formulating and evaluating the strength of recommendations for specific clinical questions on the basis of the robustness of the evidence.<br \/><br \/>&#13;\nThe Technical Guidelines Development Group, co-chaired by Professor Fred Binka and Professor Nick White (other participants are listed below), organized a technical consultation on preparation of the third edition of the\u00a0<em>Guidelines.\u00a0<\/em>Declarations of conflicts of interest were received from all participants.\u00a0A WHO guideline steering group facilitated the scoping meeting, which was convened in February 2013, to set priorities and identify which sections of the second edition of\u00a0<em>Guidelines\u00a0<\/em>were to be reviewed and to define potential new recommendations. Draft PICO questions were formulated for collation and review of the evidence. A review of data on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics was considered necessary to support dose recommendations, and a subgroup was formed for this purpose.<br \/><br \/>&#13;\nAfter the scoping meeting, the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in Liverpool, England, was commissioned to undertake systematic reviews and to assess the quality of the evidence for each priority question. The reviews involved extensive searches for published and unpublished reports of trials and highly sensitive searches of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group trials register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE\u00ae, Embase and LILACS. All the reviews have been published on line in the Cochrane Library. When insufficient evidence was available from randomized trials, published reviews of non-randomized studies were considered.<br \/><br \/>&#13;\nThe subgroup on dose recommendations reviewed published studies from MEDLINE\u00ae and Embase on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimalarial medicines. For analyses of pharmacokinetics and simulations of dosing, they used raw clinical and laboratory data from the Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network on the concentrations of antimalarial agents in plasma or\u00a0whole blood measured with validated assays in individual patients. The data had either been included in peer-reviewed publications or been submitted to regulatory authorities for drug registration. Population pharmacokinetics models were constructed, and the plasma or whole blood concentration profiles of antimalarial medicines were simulated (typically 1000 times) for different weight categories.<br \/><br \/>&#13;\nThe guideline development group met in two technical meetings, in November 2013 and June 2014, to develop and finalize recommendations based on the GRADE tables constructed on the basis of answers to the PICO questions. The Guidelines<em>\u00a0<\/em>were written by a subcommittee of the group. At various times during preparation of the guidelines, sections of the document or recommendations were reviewed by external experts and users who were not members of the group; these external peer reviewers are listed below.\u00a0Treatment recommendations were agreed by consensus, supported by systematic reviews and review of information on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Areas of disagreement were discussed extensively to reach consensus; voting was not required.<br \/><br \/><strong>Members of the guidelines development group<\/strong><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>Professor K.I.
