{"body":"<p>Correct deployment of vector control interventions is necessary to ensure adequate coverage of the targeted populations. This requires appropriate strategies for distributing LLINs, timely and quality-controlled IRS, and correct application of larvicides, supported by the necessary information, education and communication activities. Monitoring of progress indicators on vector control implementation in terms of coverage, access and use is addressed elsewhere in this manual, as this information is usually obtained outside entomological surveillance systems and is part of routine programme monitoring (see<strong> section 7<\/strong>).<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"5.6.1 Implementation","nid":423,"vid":601,"created":1567680672,"changed":1567680742,"field_content_type":{"tid":3,"name":"Content-Menulist","class":"content-menulist"},"field_references":null}
