{"body":"<p>Strong supply chain systems that allow reliable quantification, timely procurement and appropriate storage and distribution of commodities for malaria interventions are essential for malaria elimination. For case management, all points of care must have proper stocks of diagnostic and treatment commodities; for ACD surveys, commodities must be accurately quantified to ensure sufficient coverage of at-risk populations. In all cases, stocks must be adequate to adjust for changing dynamics of transmission and intervention coverage.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As the prevalence of malaria decreases, transmission becomes unstable, and countries are at increasing risk for epidemics. Epidemic preparedness plans are therefore necessary, with stockpiles of malaria commodities (diagnostic tests, anti-malarial medicines and insecticides and equipment for IRS) for epidemic response.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Even countries in which malaria transmission is very low must maintain a minimal stock of products at each level of the health care system, so that, if a case presents for care, it can be appropriately treated. In a successful elimination programme, some stock may never be used; however, expiration of unused medicines is the price to pay for ensuring that the health system is prepared for an unexpected outbreak of malaria.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"3.4 Supply chain systems","nid":315,"vid":2842,"created":1567502428,"changed":1581944009,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":44,"name":"Strategy & interventions of malaria elimination"}]}
