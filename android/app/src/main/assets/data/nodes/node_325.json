{"body":"<p>Engaging the communities targeted for interventions is important for malaria elimination. The required level of coverage, particularly as malaria prevalence is reduced to very low levels, can be achieved and sustained only if communities are fully supportive. If communities feel that they \u201cown\u201d programmes and are actively involved in their implementation, activities will be easier to implement, and coverage targets will be more likely to be reached.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Community members should play meaningful, active roles in project development and decision-making. The objectives of community participation should include:<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>encouraging appropriate health-seeking behaviour;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>strengthening community access to malaria testing, treatment and reporting;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>promoting acceptance and appropriate use of vector control tools;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>empowering communities to strengthen self-monitoring and decision-making about malaria;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>building community and local political support for eliminating malaria; and<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>increasing active community participation in elimination activities, including a surveillance system linked to district and other systems up to national level.<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><p>Achieving these objectives may involve explaining the rationale of the strategies and their benefits to the community, offering training to permit active participation, explaining the indicators to be used to evaluate success and receiving feedback on the results of interventions or strategies.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"3.6.4 Community engagement","nid":325,"vid":2849,"created":1567502800,"changed":1581944260,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":44,"name":"Strategy & interventions of malaria elimination"}]}
