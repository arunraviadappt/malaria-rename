{"body":"<p>The main consequence of antimalarial drug resistance is treatment failure. At low levels of resistance, there are no early treatment failures, but the proportion of patients with late recrudescence increases. As the level of resistance rises, recrudescence occurs earlier and earlier, until, with high-grade resistance, eventually parasitaemia fails to clear or, worse still, continues to increase (7). Slowing of parasite clearance is an indicator of increasing resistance. In artemisinin resistance, slow parasite clearance is the main manifestation of resistance (reflecting loss of susceptibility of the ring-stage parasites) (3). Increasing rates of gametocytaemia are another important manifestation, which may precede detectable increases in treatment failure rates (8). This is an important driver of the spread of antimalarial drug resistance.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Antimalarial drug resistance is not the only cause of \u201ctreatment failure\u201d, which is failure to clear malaria parasitaemia or to resolve clinical symptoms despite use of an antimalarial drug at correct doses. Incorrect dosing, incomplete adherence (compliance), poor drug quality, interactions with other drugs, compromised drug absorption, vomiting of the medicine, unusual pharmacokinetics or misdiagnosis of the disease are other causes. Treatment failure is dangerous for the patient and also for the community, as it increases malaria transmission and fuels the emergence and spread of antimalarial drug resistance.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"A7.2.2 Levels of resistance","nid":162,"vid":190,"created":1566389367,"changed":1566389418,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null}
