{"body":"<p>General recommendations often do not account for operational challenges in all contexts. For example, case investigation and reactive case detection around an index case might be easy in settings with a very low case-load and a highly clustered population but more difficult in higher transmission foci with a scattered population distribution. Evaluation of operational feasibility in a few pilot areas before wide-scale implementation can indicate the appropriate strategies for the introduction and longterm sustainable use of interventions.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"6.2.1 Operational feasibility","nid":358,"vid":786,"created":1567506425,"changed":1568360073,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null}
