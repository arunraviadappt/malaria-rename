{"body":"<p>Progression towards malaria-free status is continuous and not a set of independent stages. Countries, subnational areas and communities are at different stages in malaria elimination; their rate of progress depends on their level of investment, biological determinants (of the affected population, the parasites and the vectors), environmental factors, the strength and performance of the health system and social, demographic, political and economic realities. Thus, the time that each country will take to reach elimination depends strongly on contextual factors. Probably the two most important factors that can be acted upon are a political decision to accelerate activities and ownership and the performance of the national health system and its adaptability to new opportunities. If these two factors are in place, the time a country takes to achieve elimination depends on effective universal health coverage with the core malaria interventions (pillar 1 of the GTS) and an effective health management andinformation system that allows national malaria control programmes to direct resources, identify gaps in coverage, detect outbreaks and assess the impact of interventions (pillar 3 of the GTS). It is through these approaches that countries such as Sri Lanka have achieved elimination, and often accelerated it.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"2.7 Accelerating activities towards elimination","nid":615,"vid":3071,"created":1576240590,"changed":1582559711,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_operational_":[{"field_image":"","field_link":"","field_title":null}],"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":44,"name":"Strategy & interventions of malaria elimination"}]}
