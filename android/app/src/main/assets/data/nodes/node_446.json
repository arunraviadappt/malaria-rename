{"body":"<p>In high-transmission settings, malaria accounts for a large proportion of attendance at health services, and malaria information systems are necessarily embedded within integrated HMIS. Simple, efficient recording and reporting systems are required to track vector control activities, notably ITN distribution and IRS coverage. Systems are also required to track resistance to insecticides and antimalarial drugs. In settings with lower transmission or seeking to achieve elimination, malaria-specific reporting systems are required for the additional information demands for targeting and monitoring interventions in particular risk groups and foci.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"7.3.1 Routine systems","nid":446,"vid":2710,"created":1567688560,"changed":1580211707,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":37,"name":"Monitoring & evaluation"}]}
