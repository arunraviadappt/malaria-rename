{"body":"<p>Vector control strategies, such as use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs\/LLINs\u2074) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), together with case management (prompt access to diagnosis and effective treatment) are critical for reducing malaria morbidity and mortality, and reducing malaria transmission. In all areas, especially as programmes approach elimination, it is essential to \u201c<em>Ensure universal access to malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment<\/em>\u201d for at-risk populations (GTS pillar 1).<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In many countries, continued access to core malaria prevention will be required even as transmission is markedly reduced: a large proportion of the reduction in receptivity is due to vector control. Once elimination has been achieved, vector control may be \u201cfocalized\u201d rather than scaled back, i.e. the intervention should be made available for defined at-risk populations to prevent reintroduction or resumption of local transmission.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<div class=\"source\">\u00a0&#13;\n<div class=\"source-content\">\u2074\u00a0Since 2007, the ITNs distributed have been LLINs; however, the number of ITNs is still used as an indicator of\u00a0standard coverage and use.
