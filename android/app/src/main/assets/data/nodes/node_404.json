{"body":"<p>Drug resistance is one of the causes of treatment failure, and characterization of the molecular markers of drug resistance is an important means of understanding resistance to antimalarial treatment. Once the genetic changes associated with resistance are identified, drug resistance can be confirmed and monitored with molecular techniques. A limited number of genes involved or potentially involved in the resistance of <em>P. falciparum<\/em> to antimalarial drugs have been identified: <em>Pfcrt <\/em>(<em>P. falciparum<\/em> chloroquine resistance transporter) conferring resistance to chloroquine, <em>Pfdhfr <\/em>(<em>P. falciparum<\/em> dihydrofolate reductase) conferring resistance to pyrimethamine and <em>Pfdhps <\/em>(<em>P.<\/em> <em>falciparum<\/em> dihydropteroate synthase) conferring resistance to sulfadoxine. Increased copy numbers of <em>Pfmdr1 <\/em>(<em>P. falciparum<\/em> multidrug resistance 1 protein) and <em>Pfpm2\u20133<\/em> (<em>P.<\/em> <em>falciparum<\/em> plasmepsin 2\u20133) have been associated with <em>P. falciparum<\/em> resistance to mefloquine and piperaquine resistance, respectively. Resistance of <em>P. falciparum<\/em> to artemisinins is strongly associated with point mutations in the propeller region of the <em>PfKelch13 <\/em>gene (Table 6).<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"4.3 Molecular markers of resistance to antimalarial drugs","nid":404,"vid":2663,"created":1567598241,"changed":1579191071,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":42,"name":"Drug efficacy & resistance"}]}
