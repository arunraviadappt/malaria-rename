The key interventions recommended to prevent and control malaria in this vulnerable group include use of insecticide-treated nets or indoor residual spraying, prompt access to diagnosis and treatment and, in areas of Africa with moderate to high transmission of <i>P. falciparum<\/i>, administration of IPTi. This consists of co-administration of a full therapeutic course of SP with the second and third vaccinations against DTP and vaccination against measles delivered routinely in the Expanded Programme on Immunization \u2014usually at 10 weeks, 14 weeks and about 9 months of age, respectively\u2014to infants at risk for malaria&nbsp;<cite class=\"magic-cite\" data-ref-id=\"362701\" data-label=\"\">[84]<\/cite>.<br><br>WHO encourages co-administration of SP-IPTi in areas with moderate-to-high malaria transmission (&gt;250 cases per 1000 population and a prevalence of <i>P. falciparum\/P. vivax<\/i> <u>&gt;<\/u>10%) of Africa.
