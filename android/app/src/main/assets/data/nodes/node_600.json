{"body":"<p>Investment in basic science and product development must be sustained to create new tools and strategies for malaria elimination and its eventual global eradication. The operational feasibility, safety and cost-effectiveness of new tools and strategies should be evaluated by context-adapted operational research as a basis for reliable policy recommendations by national policy-makers and WHO. Efficient national regulatory processes (approval and registration) can substantially accelerate the introduction of new medicines, diagnostics, vector control tools and vaccines. Countries are therefore encouraged to:<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>advocate for and\/or contribute to continuous funding for basic science and product development;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>be actively involved in operational research to generate a reliable evidence base for policy recommendations and strategic planning; and<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>streamline national and regional regulatory processes to avoid unnecessary delay in the uptake of new, high-quality tools and evidence-based strategies and ensure their safe use.<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><p>Key points related to innovation and research for malaria elimination are summarized in <strong>Box 9<\/strong>.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<div class=\"grayshade-content\">&#13;\n<p><strong>BOX 9.<br \/>&#13;\nInnovation and research for malaria elimination <\/strong><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>The research agenda for malaria elimination and eradication has been defined by consultative groups within the Malaria Eradication Research Agenda.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>Substantial research and development are currently under way on new medicines, diagnostics, vector control tools and vaccines for use against malaria.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>Country-driven operational research is essential for evaluating the operational feasibility, safety and cost-effectiveness of potential wide-scale use of new tools and strategies.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>To ensure efficient regulatory review of new tools and technologies, malaria elimination programmes should proactively evaluate the product development pipeline and define pathways for regulatory approval and registration, in close collaboration with the relevant regulatory authorities.<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><\/div>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><\/ul>","title":"Innovation and research for malaria elimination","nid":600,"vid":2873,"created":1576056972,"changed":1581946414,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_operational_":[{"field_image":"","field_link":"","field_title":null}],"field_references":null}
