{"body":"<p>In the final steps of elimination, clinicians and laboratories should consistently and immediately notify the district team and national malaria programme of all confirmed malaria cases by the fastest possible means and include basic demographic, clinical and parasitological data. Case and focus investigation reports are controlled for quality in the district and centrally, and direct feedback is sent to the person or team that prepared the report.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Regular data (immediate, weekly, monthly) should be available at the local level for evaluation and should be disseminated to districts or to intermediate level, the national malaria programme and the national reference laboratory. As a country sets elimination targets, a computerized geo-referenced database should be established that covers all cases, including those seen outside the public health system. This database will support programme management and can be used for in-depth analysis and response.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Repositories of all malaria reports, records of case detection, entomological monitoring of vector behaviour and intervention quality and focus investigations, special surveys, case registers and focus registers, should be maintained at district and central levels.
