{"body":"<p>The frequency of vector sampling for measuring indicators depends on the question being posed and the available resources. The length of the transmission season and other environmental conditions that influence entomological parameters and malaria transmission should be considered. The frequency and timing of sampling should be standardized to minimize sampling bias when tracking temporal trends. Sampling is usually best undertaken during times of peak vector density and\/or malaria parasite transmission. Further information on frequency by transmission setting is provided below.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"5.4 Frequency of surveys","nid":413,"vid":3412,"created":1567678114,"changed":1587018654,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":43,"name":"Entomology & insecticide resistance"}]}
