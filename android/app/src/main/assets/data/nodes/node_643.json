{"body":"<p>WHO arranges for members of the MECP to review the national report and other relevant documentation and then to visit the country (the number of people is determined by the size of country) to gather any additional information required (see\u00a0<a href=\"\/node\/372\"> <strong>Annex 4<\/strong><\/a> for terms of reference, rules and composition of the MECP).<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Members of the panel evaluate whether the following prerequisites have been satisfactorily fulfilled:<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>a malaria surveillance system of high quality covering all the geographical areas of the country;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>evidence of no indigenous malaria cases for the past three years (based on comprehensive case investigation forms);<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>an adequate system for early detection and effective treatment of malaria cases and for subsequent clinical and epidemiological monitoring, supported by continuing education on malaria for health workers, including in the private sector;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>laboratory services that provide prompt, quality-assured parasitological diagnosis of malaria throughout the country, including the most remote and inaccessible areas;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>prompt, thorough epidemiological investigation and classification of every malaria case and focus;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>immediate mandatory notification of all malaria cases by public and private health services;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>a central computerized database of malaria cases and foci, with a geographical information system for mapping, and a national register of cases; and<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>a comprehensive national plan of action with continuing political and financial support for activities to prevent re-establishment of local transmission.<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><p>Special studies (for instance, molecular epidemiological studies by polymerase chain reaction techniques to map the distribution of sub-microscopic infections) may provide additional proof that malaria transmission has been interrupted.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The prerequisites for preventing re-establishment of malaria transmission are:<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>an adequate system for early recognition and rapid response to malaria epidemics;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>inter-country information-sharing and functional border coordination, where relevant;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>an efficient malaria surveillance system (which may be integrated into systems for other communicable diseases);<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>effective mechanisms for cooperation among all ministries and agencies involved in malaria prevention;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>a high-quality system for entomological surveillance, including monitoring of resistance of malaria vectors to insecticides, especially in areas with high receptivity; and<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>services to raise awareness and provide practical advice on prevention and early detection of imported malaria (for nationals travelling to or returning from malaria-endemic countries).<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><p>During the field visit, MECP members review the quality and completeness of the database.
