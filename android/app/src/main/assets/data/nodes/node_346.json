{"body":"<p>The report is reviewed by all MECP members. The country will be asked to clarify any technical issues or respond to questions. After any further clarification or supplementary information, the MECP submits its final evaluation report to the WHO MPAC with a recommendation to certify malaria elimination or to postpone it.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The WHO MPAC makes a final recommendation on granting malaria-free status in a summary report to the GMP which, in turn, informs the WHO Director-General, who makes the final decision and communicates it in an official letter to the national government. When malaria-free status is granted, the WHO publishes the information in the <em>Weekly epidemiological record<\/em>, <em>International travel and health <\/em>and the<em> World malaria report.<\/em> In addition, the country is listed in the official WHO <em>Register of areas where malaria elimination has been achieved<\/em>, which was established at the request of Member States. As the Register is restricted to countries and territories that have eliminated malaria by specific measures, a supplementary list was opened in 1963 for areas in which malaria never existed or disappeared without specific measures <a href=\"\/node\/364\"><em>(42)<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"5.2.2.2 Granting malaria-free status","nid":346,"vid":2867,"created":1567505620,"changed":1581946010,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":41,"name":"Certification of elimination"}]}
