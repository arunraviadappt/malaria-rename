Further trials would provide clarification but are unlikely to be done. The group was therefore unable to recommend its use in older children and adults.<\/p><p>In the absence of direct evaluations of parenteral antimalarial drugs for pre- referral treatment, the guideline development group considered the known benefits of artesunate in hospitalized patients and downgraded the quality of evidence for pre-referral situations.

However, quinine accumulates in severe vital organ dysfunction. If a patient with severe malaria has persisting acute kidney injury or there is no clinical improvement by 48 h, the dose of quinine should be reduced by one third, to 10 mg salt\/kg bw every 12 h. Dosage adjustments are not necessary if patients are receiving either haemodialysis or haemofiltration.<\/p><p><strong>Follow-on treatment<\/strong><br>The current recommendation of experts is to give parenteral antimalarial drugs for the treatment of severe malaria for a minimum of 24 h ounce started (irrespective of the patient\u2019s ability to tolerate oral medication earlier) or until the patient can tolerate oral medication, before giving the oral follow-up treatment.<\/p><p>After initial parenteral treatment, once the patient can tolerate oral therapy, it is essential to continue and complete treatment with an effective oral antimalarial drug by giving a full course of effective ACT (artesunate + amodiaquine, artemether&nbsp;+ lumefantrine or dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine). If the patient presented initially with impaired consciousness, ACTs containing mefloquine should be avoided because of an increased incidence of neuropsychiatric complications. When an ACT is not available, artesunate + clindamycin, artesunate + doxycycline, quinine + clindamycin or quinine + doxycycline can be used for follow-on treatment. Doxycycline is preferred to other tetracyclines because it can be given once daily and does not accumulate in cases of renal failure, but it should not be given to children &lt; 8 years or pregnant women. As treatment with doxycycline is begun only when the patient has recovered sufficiently, the 7-day doxycycline course finishes after the artesunate, artemether or quinine course. When available, clindamycin may be substituted in children and pregnant women.<\/p><p><strong>Continuing supportive care<\/strong><br>Patients with severe malaria require intensive nursing care, preferably in an intensive care unit where possible. Clinical observations should be made as frequently&nbsp;&nbsp; as possible and should include monitoring of vital signs, coma score and urine output. Blood glucose should be monitored every 4 h, if possible, particularly in unconscious patients.<br><br>Please refer to <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.who.int\/iris\/handle\/10665\/259356?locale-attribute=de&amp;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Rectal artesunate for pre-referral treatment of severe malaria<\/i><\/a>&nbsp;<cite class=\"magic-cite\" data-ref-id=\"362676\" data-label=\"\">[144]<\/cite>.<\/p>","field_icon":null}],"field_header":"Where complete treatment of"}],"field_content_type":{"tid":9,"name":"Accord","class":"accord"},"field_left_right_navigation":1,"field_operational_":[{"field_image":"","field_link":"","field_title":null}],"field_recommendations":1,"recommendation":"<p>All cases of suspected malaria should have a parasitological test (microscopy or Rapid diagnostic test (RDT)) to confirm the diagnosis.<br \/>\r\nBoth microscopy and RDTs should be supported by a quality assurance programme.<br \/>\r\n<font color=\"#4090CF\"><em>Good practice statement<\/em><\/font><\/p>\r\n","recommendation_title":"Rapid diagnostic test (RDT)","field_recommendation_api_url":"https:\/\/api.magicapp.org\/api\/v1\/recommendations\/?sectionId=78112","field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":66,"name":"Recommendations for case management"}]}
