This strategy is therefore likely to be effective only in areas of low-intensity malaria transmission, as a component of elimination programmes.<br \/><br \/><strong>Remarks<\/strong><br \/>This recommendation excludes high-transmission settings, as symptomatic patients make up only a small proportion of the total population carrying gametocytes within a community, and primaquine is unlikely to affect transmission.<br \/><br \/>A major concern of national policy-makers in using primaquine has been the small risk for haemolytic toxicity in G6PD-deficient people, especially where G6PD testing is not available.<br \/><br \/>Life-threatening haemolysis is considered unlikely with the 0.25mg\/kg bw dose and without G6PD testing\u00a0<cite class=\"magic-cite\" data-ref-id=\"362690\" data-label=\"\">[114]<\/cite>.<br \/><br \/><strong>Rationale for the recommendation:\u00a0<\/strong>The Guideline Development Group considered the evidence on dose\u2013response relations in the observational mosquito-feeding studies of reduced transmissibility with the dose of 0.25 mg\/kg bw and the judgement of the WHO Evidence Review Group (November 2012). Their view was that the potential public health benefits of single low-dose (0.25 mg\/kg bw) primaquine in addition to an ACT for falciparum malaria, without G6PD testing, outweigh the potential risk for adverse effects.\u00a0<\/p>","practical_info":"<p>In light of concern about the safety of the previously recommended dose of 0.75 mg\/kg bw in individuals with G6PD deficiency, a WHO panel reviewed the safety of primaquine as a <i>P. falciparum <\/i>gametocytocide and concluded that a single dose of 0.25 mg\/kg bw of primaquine base is unlikely to cause serious toxicity, even in people with G6PD deficiency\u00a0<cite class=\"magic-cite\" data-ref-id=\"362776\" data-label=\"\">[115]<\/cite>.
