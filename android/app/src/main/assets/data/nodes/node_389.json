{"body":"<p>An induced case is one that is not due to mosquito-borne transmission but to a blood transfusion or other form of parenteral inoculation of the parasite. Such cases are easy to classify if the person lives and works in an area in which there has been no known transmission for many years and has a history of blood transfusion or other exposure to blood that could have transmitted malaria. The incubation period (i.e. the delay before onset of clinical symptoms) after contamination with infected blood from a needle-stick injury ranges from 4 to 17 days, with a median of 12 days. Induced cases never give rise to clinical relapses, because there are no liver-stage parasites.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"3.3.3 Induced cases","nid":389,"vid":3524,"created":1567593169,"changed":1587401657,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":38,"name":"Concepts & practice"}]}
