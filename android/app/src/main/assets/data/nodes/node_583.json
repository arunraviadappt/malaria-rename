The trials were conducted in Colombia, Ethiopia, India, Pakistan and Thailand between 1992 and 2006.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In comparison with placebo or no primaquine:<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>14 days of primaquine (0.25 mg\/kg bw per day) reduced relapses during 15 months of follow-up by about 40% (RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.48\u20130.75, 10 trials, 1740 participants, high-quality evidence).<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><p>In comparison with 7 days of primaquine:<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>14 days of primaquine (0.25 mg\/kg bw per day) reduced relapses during 6 months of follow-up by over 50% (RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.25\u20130.81, one trial, 126 participants, low-quality evidence).<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><p>No direct comparison has been made of higher doses (0.5 mg\/kg bw for 14 days) with the standard regimen (0.25 mg\/kg bw for 14 days).<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Twelve of the 15 trials included in the review explicitly excluded people with G6PD deficiency; the remaining three did not report on this aspect.
