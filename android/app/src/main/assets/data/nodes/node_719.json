The sources and risks of residual transmission may vary by location, time and the existing components of the current malaria programme. This variation is potentially due to a combination of both mosquito and human behaviours, such as when people live in or visit forest areas or do not sleep in protected houses, or when local mosquito vector species bite and\/or rest outdoors and thereby avoid contact with IRS or ITNs\/LLINs.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"background-color:white\">\u00a0<\/span><br \/><span style=\"background-color:white\">Once elimination has been achieved, optimal vector control coverage should be maintained in receptive areas where there is a substantial risk for reintroduction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p>","practical_info":"<p style=\"margin-left:0cm\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">Access to effective vector control interventions will need to be maintained in the majority of countries and locations where malaria control has been effective.

Malaria elimination is defined as the interruption of local transmission (reduction to zero incidence of indigenous cases) of a specified malaria parasite species in a defined geographical area as a result of deliberate intervention activities.

The capacity to detect and respond to possible resurgences with appropriate vector control relies on having the necessary entomological information (i.e.<u>,<\/u> susceptibility status of vectors to insecticides, as well as their biting and resting preferences).
