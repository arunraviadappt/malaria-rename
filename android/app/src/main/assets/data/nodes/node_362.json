{"body":"<p>The impact of new tools and technologies may be substantially reduced if uptake is slowed by regulatory processes and in-country registration. Malaria elimination programmes should proactively evaluate the product development pipeline and define the pathways necessary for regulatory approval and registration, in collaboration with national and regional regulatory authorities. It is therefore recommended that national regulatory authorities participate in the national malaria elimination advisory committee.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Certain countries require local trials of medicines for national registration, with evaluation in the epidemiological and demographic context of the country. In some cases, waivers or limited field trials can be used to ensure rapid uptake. Elimination programmes should work with national regulators to define the most appropriate, efficient pathway when local trials are required.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"6.3 Regulatory environment for malaria elimination","nid":362,"vid":817,"created":1567506623,"changed":1568375427,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null}
