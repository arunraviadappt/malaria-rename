{"body":"<p>The genetic events that confer antimalarial drug resistance (without seriously damaging the parasites) are spontaneous and rare. They occur independently of the drug but are then selected by the drug, which kills sensitive parasites but not resistant ones. The resistance mechanisms that have been described to date are mutations or changes in the copy number of genes related either to the drug targets (e.g. <em>Pfdhfr<\/em>) or to the pumps (e.g. <em>Pfmdr<\/em>) that affect intraparasitic concentrations of the drug. A single genetic event may be all that is required to confer resistance, or multiple unlinked events may be necessary (epistasis). P. <em>falciparum<\/em> parasites in South-East Asia appear constitutionally to have an increased propensity to develop drug resistance.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"A7.3.1 Molecular basis","nid":164,"vid":192,"created":1566389469,"changed":1566389517,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null}
