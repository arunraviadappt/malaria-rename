{"body":"<p>Targeted training and continuous mentoring and supervision will ensure that staff understand their roles in the elimination programme and the importance of their activities for success. Rather than train entire cadres of staff at routine intervals with a standard curriculum, tailored training should be conducted in accordance with the heterogeneity of malaria transmission intensity in the country or when guidelines are changed. Between formal courses, routine supportive supervision and targeted feedback can be effective for honing staff skills and empowering them to trust the tools and systems they are using.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>To ensure that experienced staff who are of great value to the programme are retained, they should be paid sufficiently attractive salaries for their jobs, to motivate them to continue. Retention programmes, including incentives and career promotions to discourage attrition, should be considered. If staff are advised of the expected tenure of the position before they are hired, they may be encouraged to stay with the programme longer. Training many staff to perform important tasks and requiring documentation of experience and lessons learnt will mitigate any transitions that occur.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"3.3.3 Training and retaining staff","nid":314,"vid":2841,"created":1567502385,"changed":1581943971,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":44,"name":"Strategy & interventions of malaria elimination"}]}
