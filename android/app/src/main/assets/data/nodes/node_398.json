{"body":"<p>Information on the efficacy of recommended malaria treatment is critical for ensuring progress towards elimination and ensuring that patients receive efficacious treatment. WHO has prepared a standard protocol for therapeutic efficacy studies (TES) and tools for data analysis and monitoring <em><a href=\"\/node\/455\">(26)<\/a><\/em>. TES are considered the gold standard for assessing antimalarial drug efficacy, and the resulting data are used to inform national malaria treatment policy in malaria endemic countries. TES are designed for monitoring the efficacy against both <em>P.<\/em> <em>falciparum<\/em> and<em> P. vivax<\/em> of any of the recommended first- and second-line medicines as well as any medicine that is to be assessed before possible introduction into the treatment policy.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In areas in which there are very few malaria cases, it will be difficult to recruit enough patients to obtain interpretable information on drug efficacy. If these areas are pursuing malaria elimination, their surveillance systems will likely have been strengthened to improve case detection, increase case reporting from all sectors (private and public), ensure that all patients receive the full, supervised, recommended treatment (including radical cure) and confirm complete cure by following up patients at regular intervals <em><a href=\"\/node\/455\">(5)<\/a><\/em>. In these areas, monitoring of drug efficacy can be integrated into the routine surveillance system (see <a href=\"https:\/\/malariacms-staging.adappt.co.uk\/node\/405\"><strong>section 4.4<\/strong><\/a>).<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"4.1 Surveillance of antimalarial drug efficacy and drug resistance","nid":398,"vid":3054,"created":1567597347,"changed":1582558473,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":42,"name":"Drug efficacy & resistance"}]}
