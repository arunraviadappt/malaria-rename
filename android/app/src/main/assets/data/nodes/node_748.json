Determination of whether or not specific habitats are suitable for larviciding should be based on assessment by an entomologist.

Two other identified studies combined habitat manipulation with larviciding and so the effect of the two could not be separated. The two eligible studies investigated the impact of larval habitat manipulation against malaria (Martello, E., Yogeswaran, G. & Leonardi-Bee, J. unpublished findings). One study was conducted in an urban area of the Philippines in 1960 and the other in a forested area of India in 2008 where annual IRS was also conducted. The studies provided low or very low certainty evidence that the controlled release of water from flood gates of dams to discharge excess water or using spillways (overflow channels) across streams to automatically flush downstream areas with water (continually or intermittently) reduced clinical malaria incidence or parasite prevalence. The evidence was downgraded due to the lack of appropriate randomization or poor statistical reporting. The studies examined very specific interventions, each studied in a single site, which limited their generalizability. The systematic review reported a number of other studies with only entomological outcomes investigating a wide range of highly heterogeneous interventions falling under the broad term of larval habitat manipulation and\/or modification, some of which may only be appropriate in specific ecologies. Given the broad range of interventions and settings in which larval habitat manipulation and\/or modification may be applied, the potential impact, feasibility, acceptability and resource needs for each intervention is likely to be highly variable.<br \/>\u00a0<br \/>Although it is acknowledged that there is a wealth of historical research on environmental management of malaria, unfortunately this literature was insufficiently robust to be included in this systematic review. Therefore, there remains a continued need to robustly demonstrate the epidemiological impact environmental management (habitat modification and\/or manipulation) through measurement of malaria incidence or prevalence through further well-designed intervention studies.\u00a0 \u00a0<br \/><br \/><strong>Research needs<\/strong>:<br \/>The GDG encourages funding of high-quality research on the impact of habitat manipulation and\/or modification on malaria transmission to inform the development of specific WHO recommendations in this area.

If such strategies are employed, the selection of the specific intervention(s) should be highly contextual, i.e., it should take into account the specific environment the type of intervention(s) that are relevant to that environment, the resources needed and their availability, the feasibility of the intervention(s), their acceptability by local stakeholders and how they might impact equity. The selection should also take into account previous experience either gained locally or from other areas of similar ecological and epidemiological characteristics where such intervention(s) have been implemented. Additionally, the selection of the comparator should consider other interventions that are known to be cost-effective, for example, larviciding. Where the decision is taken to invest resources into larval habitat modification and\/or larval habitat manipulation, the intervention(s) should be designed and conducted with the explicit aim of generating data to demonstrate effective malaria control and preferably, supported with environmental and entomological data as secondary end-points.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>When assessing the impact of environmental management against malaria, it is important that the testing of the intervention(s) being investigated is\/are specifically conducted for the purpose of preventing or controlling malaria by reducing the availability and productivity of larval habitats. For example, dams are generally constructed for water management, irrigation or power production purposes, not for malaria control. In fact, in some cases, their construction may result in increased larval production due to the creation of standing water bodies. The controlled release of water from the impoundment of a dam, however, is considered an example of habitat manipulation, a recurrent activity which potentially controls mosquito larvae by increasing the flow rate of downstream water with the aim of preventing mosquito \u00a0development and so controlling malaria transmission. This is one example of the multitude of interventions that fall under the broad category of habitat modification and\/or manipulation. To be able to generate evidence on the efficacy of larval habitat modification and\/or manipulation in preventing malaria, and to facilitate the interpretation of the evidence once generated, it is important to well define the interventions that are being evaluated and, importantly, compare how the water conditions of larval habitats at the intervention and control sites are affected. For example, if the intervention aimed to increase the water flow of downstream areas, the evaluation \u00a0should include an assessment of \u00a0whether this was achieved, as well as to what extent this impacted the development of the immature and adult stages of the mosquito and, ultimately, whether there was an epidemiological impact on against malaria in the intervention arms compared to control areas. This information will then support the evolution of WHO guidance in this area and, ultimately, guide the choice and implementation of efficacious interventions.<\/p>","field_icon":null},{"field_title":"Larvivorous fish (2019)","field_content":"<p><strong>Larvivorous fish (2019)<\/strong><br><br>No recommendation can be made because no evidence on the effectiveness of larvivorous fish for the prevention and control of malaria was identified.<\/p>","justification":"<p><span style=\"background-color:rgb( 255 , 255 , 255 )\">The systematic review conducted in 2017 on use of larvivorous fish\u00a0<\/span><cite class=\"magic-cite\" data-ref-id=\"362680\" data-label=\"\">[61]<\/cite><span style=\"background-color:rgb( 255 , 255 , 255 )\">\u00a0did not identify any studies demonstrating \u00a0impact on malaria and so there is insufficient evidence to support a recommendation.
