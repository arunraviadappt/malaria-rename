{"body":"<p>Malaria treatment should follow national policies and WHO guidelines <a href=\"\/node\/364\"><em>(8)<\/em><\/a>. Treatment that fully clears malaria infection is required in the context of malaria elimination. Thus, for cases due to <em>P. vivax<\/em> or <em>P. ovale<\/em>, in addition to clearance of the blood infection, anti-relapse therapy (primaquine) is required to clear liver-stage parasites; and, for all infections caused by <em>P. falciparum<\/em>, a gametocytocidal drug (primaquine) should be administered in addition to treatment for the blood stage to reduce and eventually halt transmission.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Treatment should be provided through all channels of service delivery: public facilities, private facilities and community outreach. The optimal mix will depend on the country. As transmission and malaria incidence are reduced, increased coverage and better access to high-quality care should be ensured through all three channels.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"Introduction","nid":635,"vid":2797,"created":1576662401,"changed":1581930401,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_operational_":[{"field_image":"","field_link":"","field_title":null}],"field_references":null}
