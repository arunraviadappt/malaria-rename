{"body":"<p>Diagnosis of P. <em>vivax<\/em>, P. <em>ovale<\/em>, and P. <em>malariae<\/em> malaria is based on microscopy. P. <em>knowlesi<\/em> is frequently misdiagnosed under the microscope, as the young ring forms are similar to those of P. <em>falciparum<\/em>, the late trophozoites are similar to those of P. <em>malariae<\/em>, and parasite development is asynchronous. Rapid diagnostic tests based on immunochromatographic methods are available for the detection of P. <em>vivax<\/em> malaria; however, they are relatively insensitive for detecting P. <em>malariae<\/em> and P. <em>ovale<\/em> parasitaemia. Rapid diagnostic antigen tests for human <em>Plasmodium<\/em> species show poor sensitivity for P. <em>knowlesi<\/em> infections in humans with low parasitaemia (15).<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"A6.2 Diagnosis","nid":150,"vid":1222,"created":1566387450,"changed":1571815940,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null}
