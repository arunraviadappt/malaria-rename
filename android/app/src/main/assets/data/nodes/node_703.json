{"body":"<p><strong>Suspected malaria<\/strong><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The signs and symptoms of malaria are non-specific. Malaria is suspected clinically primarily on the basis of fever or a history of fever. There is no combination of signs or symptoms that reliably distinguishes malaria from other causes of fever; diagnosis based only on clinical features has very low specificity and results in overtreatment. Other possible causes of fever and whether alternative or additional treatment is required must always be carefully considered. The focus of malaria diagnosis should be to identify patients who truly have malaria, to guide rational use of antimalarial medicines.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In malaria-endemic areas, malaria should be suspected in any patient presenting with a history of fever or temperature \u2265 37.5 \u00b0C and no other obvious cause. In areas in which malaria transmission is stable (or during the high-transmission period of seasonal malaria), malaria should also be suspected in children with palmar pallor or a haemoglobin concentration of &lt; 8 g\/dL. High-transmission settings include many parts of sub-Saharan Africa and some parts of Oceania.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In settings where the incidence of malaria is very low, parasitological diagnosis of all cases of fever may result in considerable expenditure to detect only a few patients with\u00a0malaria. In these settings, health workers should be trained to identify patients who may have been exposed to malaria (e.g. recent travel to a malaria-endemic area without protective measures) and have fever or a history of fever with no other obvious cause, before they conduct a parasitological test.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><em>In all settings, suspected malaria should be confirmed with a parasitological test<\/em>. The results of parasitological diagnosis should be available within a short time (&lt; 2 h) of the patient presenting. In settings where parasitological diagnosis is not possible, a decision to provide antimalarial treatment must be based on the probability that the illness is malaria.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In children &lt; 5 years, the practical algorithms for management of the sick child provided by the WHO\u2013United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) strategy for Integrated Management of Childhood Illness <a href=\"#92\"><em>[92]<\/em><\/a> should be used to ensure full assessment and appropriate case management at first-level health facilities and at the community level.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><strong>Parasitological diagnosis<\/strong><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The benefit of parasitological diagnosis relies entirely on an appropriate management response of health care providers. The two methods used routinely for parasitological diagnosis of malaria are light microscopy and immunochromatographic RDTs. The latter detect parasite-specific antigens or enzymes that are either genus or species specific.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Both microscopy and RDTs must be supported by a quality assurance programme. Antimalarial treatment should be limited to cases with positive tests, and patients with negative results should be reassessed for other common causes of fever and treated appropriately.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In nearly all cases of symptomatic malaria, examination of thick and thin blood films by a competent microscopist will reveal malaria parasites. Malaria RDTs should be used if quality-assured malaria microscopy is not readily available. RDTs for detecting PfHRP2 can be useful for patients who have received incomplete antimalarial treatment, in whom blood films can be negative. This is particularly likely if the patient received a recent dose of an artemisinin derivative. If the initial blood film examination is negative in patients with manifestations compatible with severe malaria, a series of blood films should be examined at 6\u201312 h intervals, or an RDT (preferably one detecting PfHRP2) should be performed. If both the slide examination and the RDT results are negative, malaria is extremely unlikely, and other causes of the illness should be sought and treated.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>This document does not include recommendations for use of specific RDTs or for interpreting test results. For guidance, see the WHO manual <em><a href=\"https:\/\/apps.who.int\/iris\/handle\/10665\/44657\">Universal access to malaria diagnostic testing<\/a><\/em><a href=\"#93\"><em>[93]<\/em><\/a><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><strong>Diagnosis of malaria<\/strong><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In patients with suspected severe malaria and in other high-risk groups, such as patients living with HIV\/AIDS, absence or delay of parasitological diagnosis should not delay an immediate start of antimalarial treatment.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>At present, molecular diagnostic tools based on nucleic-acid amplification techniques (e.g. loop-mediated isothermal amplification or PCR) do not have a role in the clinical management of malaria.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Where\u00a0<em>P. vivax<\/em>\u00a0malaria is common and microscopy is not available, it is recommended that a combination RDT be used that allows detection of P. vivax (pLDH antigen from\u00a0<em>P. vivax<\/em>) or pan-malarial antigens (Pan-pLDH or aldolase).<br \/><strong>Light microscopy<\/strong><br \/>&#13;\nMicroscopy not only provides a highly sensitive, specific diagnosis of malaria when performed well but also allows quantification of malaria parasites and identification of the infecting species. Light microscopy involves relatively high costs for training and supervision, and the accuracy of diagnosis is strongly dependent on the competence of the microscopist. Microscopy technicians may also contribute to the diagnosis of non-malarial diseases.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Although nucleic acid amplification-based tests are more sensitive, light microscopy is still considered the \u201cfield standard\u201d against which the sensitivity and specificity of other methods must be assessed. A skilled microscopist can detect asexual parasites at a density of &lt; 10 per \u00b5L of blood, but under typical field conditions, the limit of sensitivity is approximately 100 parasites per \u00b5L\u00a0<a href=\"#94\"><em>[94]<\/em><\/a>. This limit of detection approximates the lower end of the pyrogenic density range. Thus, microscopy provides good specificity for diagnosing malaria as the cause of a presenting febrile illness. More sensitive methods allow detection of an increasing proportion of cases of incidental parasitaemia in endemic areas, thus reducing the specificity of a positive test.

RDTs for detecting <em>p<\/em>LDH from <em>P. falciparum<\/em> are generally less sensitive and more specific than those for detecting HRP2, with an average sensitivity (95% CI) of 93.2% (88.0\u201396.2%) and a specificity of 98.5% (96.7\u201399.4%).
