{"body":"<p>ACD requires extra effort to find malaria cases among people who do not present to health facilities, for various reasons, including living in a remote area, populations such as migrants and refugees who may not use or have access to routine health care and asymptomatic infections. ACD can play an important role in elimination programmes by detecting infected people who may risk transmitting malaria but are not detected by PCD. As in PCD, all patients with confirmed malaria should receive the full recommended treatment, be followed up to ensure that the infection is cleared and be reported to health information systems.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>If ACD is conducted because of limited or under-utilization of health care services, it may comprise initial screening for symptoms, followed by appropriate laboratory confirmation. In low-transmission settings or as part of a focus investigation, ACD may consist of testing of a defined population group without prior symptom screening (population-wide or mass testing) in order to identify asymptomatic infections.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>ACD has limited benefit for <em>P. vivax <\/em>malaria, because liver-stage hypnozoites cannot be detected with current testing methods. In subtropical areas (and, more markedly in the past, in temperate climates), vivax malaria often has a seasonal pattern. Intensified case detection could be a rational choice for ensuring detection of relapses and delayed primary attacks during those seasons.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"2.4.1.2 Active case detection","nid":266,"vid":2794,"created":1567085605,"changed":1581930112,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":44,"name":"Strategy & interventions of malaria elimination"}]}
