{"body":"<p>CHWs extend public health services to hard-to-reach areas or underserved populations to expand diagnosis and treatment. Often, these workers are designated to a health facility, the staff of which oversee their activities and provide health commodities and to which the CHWs report cases and use of commodities. In areas with relatively high caseloads, CHWs may report aggregated data monthly. In elimination settings, they should be capable of immediate diagnosis, treatment and case notification and, when possible, participate in ACD, case and focus investigations.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The minimum data collected during community surveillance are the same as those collected at health posts (<a href=\"\/node\/463\"><strong>Annex 6<\/strong><\/a>). The records of such services should be reported and analysed separately from national data; otherwise, national trends will be skewed by additional cases seen by CHWs. Cases detected passively through the routine system should be reported separately from those detected actively in the community (see <a href=\"\/node\/383\"><strong>section 3.2<\/strong><\/a>). In settings in which CHWs are well established and the data they report are unlikely to change trends, there is no harm in aggregating the data into health facility reports. Mobile health applications have made it possible to establish efficient surveillance systems involving CHWs and volunteers <em><a href=\"\/node\/455\">(14)<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n","title":"2.7.3 Surveillance by community health workers","nid":416,"vid":2608,"created":1567679296,"changed":1578664080,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":39,"name":"Establishing surveillance systems"}]}
