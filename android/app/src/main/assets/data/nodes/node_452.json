{"body":"<p>This document defines a set of 46 indicators that can be used to track malaria programmes, as shown in <strong>Table 14<\/strong>. The indicators take into account:<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>\u00a0the resources available for malaria control (programme financing, commodities);<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>\u00a0levels of service provision (intervention coverage) and the performance of systems for\u00a0 \u00a0surveillance, monitoring and evaluation; and<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>\u00a0trends in infection and disease.<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><p>Twelve of the 46 indicators are considered to be core indicators (shaded), and the other 31 are supporting indicators. The applicability of an indicator in a programme settings is shown as generally highly relevant (a closed circle) or potentially relevant (open circle). The settings considered include the level of transmission, whether a country is in sub-Saharan Africa and the administrative level.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Although some interventions are important at all stages of malaria control and elimination (e.g. ensuring that all patients with suspected malaria receive a diagnostic test), a particular indicator may have lower priority than others as the programme evolves. Thus, if 100% of suspected cases routinely receive a diagnostic test, this indicator may not be considered as strong in routine monitoring of an elimination programme as one that reflects the proportion of cases investigated. The recommended indicators for programmes close to elimination reflect this reprioritization. Eight indicators (7.1\u20137.8) concern the performance of systems for surveillance monitoring and evaluation.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"7.5 Recommended indicators on the continuum to elimination","nid":452,"vid":2718,"created":1567747013,"changed":1580214121,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":27,"name":"Surveillance of elimination"}]}
