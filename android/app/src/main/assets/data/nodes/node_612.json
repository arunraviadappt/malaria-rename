{"body":"<p>This section describes the core elements of a surveillance system that will allow countries to achieve malaria elimination. Surveillance of malaria infection in the human population is the backbone of malaria elimination.<sup>11<\/sup>\u00a0Identifying where transmission is occurring with increasing accuracy will permit targeted, effective responses where they matter most. Steady improvements in the quality, timeliness and use of surveillance information must begin early in malaria programmes to ensure that elimination work is well directed and monitored. Ultimately, surveillance will become part of the intervention, focused on case characterization, treatment and investigation and on identification, management and clearance of transmission foci.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Malaria surveillance systems are described extensively in operational manuals on malaria elimination <a href=\"\/node\/364\"><em>(32)<\/em><\/a> and malaria control <a href=\"\/node\/364\"><em>(33)<\/em><\/a> issued by WHO.
