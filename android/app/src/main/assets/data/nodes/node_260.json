{"body":"<p>As malaria incidence falls and elimination is approached, increasing heterogeneity in transmission will result in foci with ongoing transmission, in which vector control should be enhanced <a href=\"\/node\/364\"><em>(25)<\/em><\/a>. Such foci may be due to particularly intense vectorial capacity, lapsed prevention and treatment services, changes in vectors or parasites that make the current strategies less effective, or reintroduction of malaria parasites by the movement of infected people or, more rarely, infected mosquitoes.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The vector species should be identified and their susceptibility to currently used insecticides evaluated. Supplementary vector control may be justified in some settings,such as for vectors that are not vulnerable to ITNs\/LLINs or IRS due to physiological or behavioural resistance. Supplementary vector control should be based on WHO-recommended strategies and with products approved by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"2.3.3 Vector control activities in active transmission foci","nid":260,"vid":2788,"created":1567085018,"changed":1581929277,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":44,"name":"Strategy & interventions of malaria elimination"}]}
