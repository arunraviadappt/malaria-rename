{"body":"<p>Certification confirms to the international community that an entire country has an adequate system for preventing re-establishment of local malaria transmission. It also demonstrates an accomplishment made possible by the necessary political will and vision, the required legislative and regulatory framework, adequate financial and administrative resources, personnel and technological capacity.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Reliable information on the global distribution of malaria is necessary to assess the risk of international travellers for exposure to malaria and the epidemiological risk of importation of malaria parasites into malaria-free areas that are receptive to transmission. Therefore, certified countries should continue to report to WHO annually on maintenance of their malaria-free status, providing information on reported malaria cases and their classification (for more information, see <strong><a href=\"\/node\/378\">Annex 9<\/a><\/strong>).<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>A minimum indication of possible transmission re-establishment would be the occurrence of three or more indigenous malaria infections of the same species per year in the same focus for three consecutive years. Because certification represents recognition of a considerable operational achievement, a careful national investigation and consultation with WHO will be conducted before a country\u2019s malaria-free certification status is lost. As of November 2016, no certification had been withdrawn.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"5.3 Follow-up of WHO certification","nid":347,"vid":2868,"created":1567505788,"changed":1581946049,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":41,"name":"Certification of elimination"}]}
