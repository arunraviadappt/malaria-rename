{"body":"<p><em>Plasmodium<\/em> vivax accounts for approximately half of all malaria cases outside Africa (1\u20133). It is prevalent in the Middle East, Asia, the Western Pacific and Central and South America. With the exception of the Horn, it is rarer in Africa, where there is a high prevalence of the Duffy-negative phenotype, particularly in West Africa, although cases are reported in both Mauritania and Mali (3). In most areas where P. vivax is prevalent, the malaria transmission rates are low (except on the island of New Guinea). Affected populations achieve only partial immunity to this parasite, and so people of all ages are at risk for P. <em>vivax<\/em> malaria (3). Where both P. <em>falciparum<\/em> and P. <em>vivax<\/em> are prevalent, the incidence rates of P. <em>vivax<\/em> tend to peak at a younger age than for P. <em>falciparum<\/em>. This is because each P. vivax inoculation may be followed by several relapses. The other human malaria parasite species, P. malariae and P. ovale (which is in fact two sympatric species), are less common. P. knowlesi, a simian parasite, causes occasional cases of malaria in or near forested areas of South-East Asia and the Indian subcontinent (4). In parts of the island of Borneo, P. knowlesi is the predominant cause of human malaria and an important cause of severe malaria.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Of the six species of <em>Plasmodium<\/em> that affect humans, only P. <em>vivax<\/em> and the two species of P. <em>ovale<\/em> (5) form hypnozoites, which are dormant parasite stages in the liver that cause relapse weeks to years after the primary infection. P. <em>vivax<\/em> preferentially invades reticulocytes, and repeated illness causes chronic anaemia, which can be debilitating and sometimes life-threatening, particularly in young children (6). Recurrent vivax malaria is an important impediment to human and economic development in affected populations. In areas where P. <em>falciparum<\/em> and P. <em>vivax<\/em> co-exist, intensive malaria control often has a greater effect on P. <em>falciparum<\/em>, as P. <em>vivax<\/em>, is more resilient to interventions.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Although P. <em>vivax<\/em> has been considered to be a benign form of malaria, it may sometimes cause severe disease (7). The major complication is anaemia in young children. In Papua province, Indonesia (7), and in Papua New Guinea (8), where malaria transmission is intense, P. <em>vivax<\/em> is an important cause of malaria morbidity and mortality, particularly in young infants and children. Occasionally, older patients develop vital organ involvement similar to that in severe and complicated P. <em>falciparum<\/em> malaria (9, 10). During pregnancy, infection with P. <em>vivax<\/em>, as with P. <em>falciparum<\/em>, increases the risk for abortion and reduces birth weight (11, 12). In primigravidae, the reduction in birth weight is approximately two thirds that associated with P. <em>falciparum<\/em>. In one large series, this effect increased with successive pregnancies (11).<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>P. <em>knowlesi<\/em> is a zoonosis that normally affects long- and pig-tailed macaque monkeys. It has a daily asexual cycle, resulting in a rapid replication rate and high parasitaemia. P. <em>knowlesi<\/em> may cause a fulminant disease similar to severe falciparum malaria (with the exception of coma, which does not occur) (13, 14). Co-infection with other species is common.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"A6.1 Introduction","nid":149,"vid":174,"created":1566386952,"changed":1566387443,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null}
