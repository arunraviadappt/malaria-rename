Some novel antimalarial agents are already registered in some countries. The decision to recommend antimalarial drugs for general use depends on the strength of the evidence for safety and efficacy and the context of use. In general, when there are no satisfactory alternatives, newly registered drugs may be recommended; however, for global or unrestricted recommendations, considerably more evidence than that submitted for registration is usually required, to provide sufficient confidence for their safety, efficacy and relative merits as compared with currently recommended treatments.<br \/><br \/>Several new antimalarial drugs or new combinations have been introduced recently. Some are still in the pre-registration phase and are not discussed here. Arterolane + piperaquine, artemisinin + piperaquine base and artemisinin + napththoquine are new ACTs, which are registered and used in some countries. In addition, there are several new generic formulations of existing drugs. None of these yet has a sufficient evidence base for general recommendation (i.e. unrestricted use).<br \/><br \/><strong>Artesunate + pyronaridine<\/strong><br \/>A systematic review of artesunate + pyronaridine included six trials with a total of 3718 patients. Artesunate + pyronaridine showed good efficacy as compared with artemether + lumefantrine and artesunate + mefloquine in adults and older children with <i>P. falciparum <\/i>malaria, but the current evidence for young children is insufficient to be confident that the drug is as effective as currently recommended options. In addition, regulatory authorities noted slightly higher hepatic transaminase concentrations in artesunate + pyronaridine recipients than in comparison groups and recommended further studies to characterize the risk for hepatotoxicity. Preliminary data from repeat-dosing studies are reassuring.<br \/><br \/>In 2012, artesunate-pyronaridine was granted a positive scientific opinion under the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Article 58 procedure, but with a restricted label, mainly due to concerns over\u00a0potential hepatotoxicity of the pyronaridine component, efficacy in children under 5 years of age, and safety, especially with repeat dosing\u00a0<cite class=\"magic-cite\" data-ref-id=\"362715\" data-label=\"\">[109]<\/cite>. In 2015, an EMA Scientific Advisory Group concluded that cumulative safety data on hepatic events had provided sufficient evidence to alleviate concerns over hepatotoxicity and thus to allow recommendation of the use of artesunate pyronaridine for the treatment and re-treatment of uncomplicated malaria in patients without signs of hepatic injury (including children weighing 5 kg and over).<br \/><br \/>The EMA therefore modified the product label to remove all restrictions on repeat dosing, on use only in areas of high antimalarial drug resistance and low malaria transmission, and on requirements to monitor liver function. In addition, it granted a positive scientific opinion for artesunate-pyronaridine granules for the treatment of children with a body weight of 5\u201320 kg\u00a0<cite class=\"magic-cite\" data-ref-id=\"362741\" data-label=\"\">[108]<\/cite>.\u00a0Artesunate-pyronaridine was included in WHO\u2019s list of prequalified medicines for malaria in April 2012, based on the EMA\u2019s positive scientific opinion of this product in accordance with Article 58. Since labelling provisions are based on EMA conclusions, these provisions were updated as a result of the EMA\u2019s 2015 review. Products included in the WHO prequalification list are those that have been assessed through the various mechanisms and found to comply with WHO-recommended regulatory standards and requirements for quality, safety and efficacy.<br \/><br \/>In June 2017, artesunate-pyronaridine was also added to the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines and Model List of Essential Medicines for Children. Due to the hepatotoxicity concerns identified in 2012, the WHO <i>Guidelines for the treatment of malaria<\/i> (2015) did not recommend the use of artesunate-pyronaridine for general use. A further meeting in December 2017 resulted in the need for GMP to request, in 2018, the support of the WHO Advisory Committee on Safety of Medicinal Products to conduct an independent expert review of all available data and information. Having completed its review, the committee considered that the current safety restrictions on the use of artesunate-pyronaridine (Pyramax\u00ae) for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, as stated in the <i>Guidelines for the treatment of malaria<\/i>, are no longer justified\u00a0<cite class=\"magic-cite\" data-ref-id=\"362715\" data-label=\"\">[109]<\/cite>.

The frequency and pattern of relapses varies geographically, with relapse rates generally ranging from 8% to 80%. Temperate long-latency <em>P. vivax <\/em>strains are still prevalent in many areas. Recent evidence suggests that, in endemic areas where people are inoculated frequently with <em>P. vivax<\/em>, a significant proportion of the population harbours dormant but \u201cactivatable\u201d hypnozoites. The exact mechanism of activation of dormant hypnozoites is unclear.

Thus, the radical curative efficacy of primaquine must be set against the prevalent relapse frequency and the likely burden of \u201cactivatable\u201d hypnozoites. Experimental studies on vivax malaria and the relapsing simian malaria <em>P. cynomolgi <\/em>suggest that the total dose of 8-aminoquinoline given is the main determinant of radical curative efficacy.

G6PD deficiency is an inherited sex-linked genetic disorder, which is associated with some protection against <i>P. falciparum <\/i>and&nbsp;<i>P. vivax <\/i>malaria but increased susceptibility to oxidant haemolysis. The prevalence of G6PD deficiency varies, but in tropical areas it is typically 3\u201335%; high frequencies are found only in areas where malaria is or has been endemic. There are many (&gt; 180) different G6PD deficiency genetic variants; nearly all of which make the red cells susceptible to oxidant haemolysis, but the severity of haemolysis may vary. Primaquine generates reactive intermediate metabolites that are oxidant and cause variable haemolysis in G6PD-deficient individuals. It also causes methemoglobinaemia. The severity of haemolytic anaemia depends on the dose of primaquine and on the variant of the G6PD enzyme. Fortunately, primaquine is eliminated rapidly so haemolysis is self-limiting once the drug is stopped. In the absence of exposure to primaquine or another oxidant agent, G6PD deficiency rarely causes clinical manifestations so, many patients are unaware of their G6PD status.

Artemether can be given as an oil-based intramuscular injection or orally. In severe falciparum malaria, the concentration of the parent compound predominates after intramuscular injection, whereas parenteral artesunate is hydrolysed rapidly and almost completely to dihydroartemisinin. Given intramuscularly, artemether may be absorbed more slowly and more erratically than water-soluble artesunate, which is absorbed rapidly and reliably after intramuscular injection. These pharmacological advantages may explain the clinical superiority of parenteral artesunate over artemether in severe malaria.<\/p><p>Artemether is dispensed dissolved in oil (groundnut, sesame seed) and given by intramuscular injection into the anterior thigh.<\/p><p>Therapeutic dose<i>: <\/i>The initial dose of artemether is 3.2 mg\/kg bw intramuscularly (to the anterior thigh). The maintenance dose is 1.6 mg\/kg bw intramuscularly daily.<\/p><p><strong>Quinine<\/strong><br \/>Quinine treatment for severe malaria was established before the methods for modern clinical trials were developed. Several salts of quinine have been formulated for parenteral use, but the dihydrochloride is the most widely used. The peak concentrations after intramuscular quinine in severe malaria are similar to those after intravenous infusion. Studies of pharmacokinetics show that a loading dose of quinine (20 mg salt\/kg bw, twice the maintenance dose) provides therapeutic plasma concentrations within 4 h. The maintenance dose of quinine (10 mg salt\/ kg bw) is administered at 8-h intervals, starting 8 h after the first dose. If there is no improvement in the patient\u2019s condition within 48 h, the dose should be reduced by one third, i.e. to 10 mg salt\/kg bw every 12 h.<\/p><p>Rapid intravenous administration of quinine is dangerous. Each dose of parenteral quinine must be administered as a slow, rate-controlled infusion (usually diluted in 5% dextrose and infused over 4 h). The infusion rate should not exceed 5 mg salt\/kg bw per h.<\/p><p>Whereas many antimalarial drugs are prescribed in terms of base, for historical reasons quinine doses are usually recommended in terms of salt (usually sulphate for oral use and dihydrochloride for parenteral use). Recommendations for the doses of this and other antimalarial agents should state clearly whether the salt or the base is being referred to; doses with different salts must have the same base equivalents. Quinine must never be given by intravenous bolus injection, as lethal hypotension may result.<\/p><p>Quinine dihydrochloride should be given by rate-controlled infusion in saline\u00a0\u00a0 or dextrose solution. If this is not possible, it should be given by intramuscular injection to the anterior thigh; quinine should not be injected into the buttock in order to avoid sciatic nerve injury. The first dose should be split, with 10 mg\/kg bw into each thigh. Undiluted quinine dihydrochloride at a concentration of 300 mg\/ mL is acidic (pH 2) and painful when given by intramuscular injection, so it is best to administer it either in a buffered formulation or diluted to a concentration of 60\u2013100 mg\/mL for intramuscular injection. Gluconate salts are less acidic and better tolerated than the dihydrochloride salt when given by the intramuscular and rectal routes.<\/p><p>As the first (loading) dose is the most important in the treatment of severe malaria, it should be reduced only if there is clear evidence of adequate pre-treatment before presentation. Although quinine can cause hypotension if administered rapidly, and overdose is associated with blindness and deafness, these adverse effects are rare in the treatment of severe malaria. The dangers of insufficient treatment (i.e. death from malaria) exceed those of excessive initial treatment.<\/p>","field_icon":null}],"field_header":"If artesunate is not"},{"field_accordian":[{"field_title":"Where complete treatment of","field_content":"Where complete treatment of severe malaria is not possible, but injections are available, give adults and children a single intramuscular dose of artesunate, and refer to an appropriate facility for further care.

If the patient presented initially with impaired consciousness, ACTs containing mefloquine should be avoided because of an increased incidence of neuropsychiatric complications. When an ACT is not available, artesunate + clindamycin, artesunate + doxycycline, quinine + clindamycin or quinine + doxycycline can be used for follow-on treatment. Doxycycline is preferred to other tetracyclines because it can be given once daily and does not accumulate in cases of renal failure, but it should not be given to children &lt; 8 years or pregnant women. As treatment with doxycycline is begun only when the patient has recovered sufficiently, the 7-day doxycycline course finishes after the artesunate, artemether or quinine course.
