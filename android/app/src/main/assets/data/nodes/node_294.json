{"body":"<p>There are few additional WHO-endorsed strategies for accelerating a reduction in transmission at population level. Population-wide medicine-based strategies to eliminate parasite reservoirs within a short time are being explored. Currently, only mass drug administration can be considered in a few, specific settings to accelerate <em>P.<\/em> <em>falciparum<\/em> elimination. This strategy has several key components.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>It should achieve high coverage in the target population, be<strong> time limited<\/strong>, and be used in the context of high-quality coverage of all other core malaria interventions in the path to elimination.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>It <strong>should not replace<\/strong> the responsibility for achieving high coverage of all core malaria interventions <strong>or resolve failures<\/strong> in implementation of those core strategies.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>It should be directed to the entire population at risk in a given location.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>The drug used should have a very high safety profile. The reduction in transmission is expected to be higher if the therapeutic levels of a medicine last longer; therefore, clearance of existing parasites and a prophylactic period render people insusceptible to new infections.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>The drug may be directed against asexual stages (e.g. ACT) or may also target the sexual stage (e.g. low-dose primaquine).<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><p>Recent reviews of mass drug administration and MPAC recommendations on its use are available <a href=\"\/node\/364\"><em>(34,35)<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"2.7.1 Population-wide medicine-based strategies","nid":294,"vid":2824,"created":1567146392,"changed":1581942779,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":44,"name":"Strategy & interventions of malaria elimination"}]}
