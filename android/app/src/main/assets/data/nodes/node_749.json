All patients with suspected malaria should be treated on the basis of a confirmed diagnosis by microscopy examination or RDT testing of a blood sample. Correct diagnosis in malaria-endemic areas is particularly important for the most vulnerable population groups, such as young children and non-immune populations, in whom falciparum malaria can be rapidly fatal. High specificity will reduce unnecessary treatment with antimalarial drugs and improve the diagnosis of other febrile illnesses in all settings.<br>\n<br>\nWHO strongly advocates a policy of \u201ctest, treat and track\u201d to improve the quality of care and surveillance.<\/span><\/p>\n","practical_info":null,"field_icon":null}],"field_header":"All cases of suspected malaria"}],"field_content_type":{"tid":9,"name":"Accord","class":"accord"},"field_left_right_navigation":1,"field_operational_":[{"field_image":"","field_link":"","field_title":null}],"field_recommendations":1,"recommendation":"<p>All cases of suspected malaria should have a parasitological test (microscopy or Rapid diagnostic test (RDT)) to confirm the diagnosis.<br \/>\r\nBoth microscopy and RDTs should be supported by a quality assurance programme.<br \/>\r\n<font color=\"#4090CF\"><em>Good practice statement<\/em><\/font><\/p>\r\n","recommendation_title":"Rapid diagnostic test (RDT)","field_recommendation_api_url":"https:\/\/api.magicapp.org\/api\/v1\/recommendations\/?sectionId=78095","field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":66,"name":"Recommendations for case management"},{"tid":45,"name":"Diagnosis"}]}
