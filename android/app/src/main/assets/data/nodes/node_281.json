{"body":"<p>An imported case is one that is acquired outside the area in which it was diagnosed. In the elimination phase, the \u201carea\u201d should usually correspond to a focus. Recording cases imported within the same country may be complicated, as a case may be considered \u201cimported\u201d from a focus or district but \u201clocally acquired\u201d from a province. One solution might be to report such cases as \u201cindigenous\u201d in the area in which they were acquired and not as \u201cimported\u201d in the area in which they were detected. Subsequently, an adequate response should be made to a case detected in a highly receptive area where it could generate secondary cases. In reporting to WHO, only cases imported from other countries should be considered \u201cimported\u201d.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The main concern with imported cases is spread in the local area. The household and neighbouring households of a case should be alerted and asked to report any suspected malaria illness. An investigation, with screening and\/or testing of people in the case household and possibly neighbouring households, could be undertaken to identify additional infections. The finding of other cases (perhaps characterized as \u201cintroduced\u201d) suggests local transmission, and activities to stop transmission should be instituted; evaluation of the vulnerability and receptivity of the area should be considered.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"2.6.3.1 Imported cases","nid":281,"vid":2810,"created":1567145593,"changed":1581932582,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":27,"name":"Surveillance of elimination"}]}
