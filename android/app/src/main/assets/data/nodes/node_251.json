{"body":"<p>This and subsequent sections describe the work required as countries approach malaria elimination, moving from low to no local transmission. Key strategies and interventions for malaria elimination are summarized in <strong>Box 4. <\/strong>Before elimination is attempted, a core set of interventions should already be in place, including optimal coverage of vector control, high-quality, timely case management, and an ever-improving information and surveillance system capable of confirming and characterizing cases, and measuring intervention coverage and transmission dynamics.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<div class=\"grayshade\">&#13;\n<p><strong>BOX 4.\u00a0<\/strong><br \/><strong>Strategies and interventions for malaria elimination: key points <\/strong><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>Most countries have diverse transmission intensity, and factors such as ecology, immunity, vector behaviour, social factors and health system characteristics influence both the diversity of transmission and the effectiveness of tools, intervention packages and strategies in each locality.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>To manage the inherent complexity of addressing transmission intensities in different geographical areas, malaria programmes should stratify their national maps of malaria distribution into discrete areas.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>Stratification should, if possible:&#13;\n\t<ul><li>differentiate receptive from non-receptive areas;<\/li>&#13;\n\t\t<li>identify receptive areas in which malaria transmission has already been curtailed by current interventions;<\/li>&#13;\n\t\t<li>distinguish between areas with widespread transmission and those in which transmission occurs only in discrete foci;<\/li>&#13;\n\t\t<li>differentiate strata by transmission intensity, particularly if different intensities are being addressed by different sets of interventions; and<\/li>&#13;\n\t\t<li>determine geographical variations and population characteristics that are associated with vulnerability.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<\/ul><\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>Stratification allows better targeting and efficiency, with assignment of specific packages of interventions and deployment strategies to designated strata.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>Stratification packages may include:&#13;\n\t<ul><li>further enhancement and optimization of vector control;<\/li>&#13;\n\t\t<li>further strengthening of timely detection, high-quality diagnosis (confirmation) and management and tracking of cases;<\/li>&#13;\n\t\t<li>strategies to accelerate clearance of parasites or vectors in order to reduce transmission rapidly when possible; and<\/li>&#13;\n\t\t<li>information, detection and response systems to identify, investigate and clear remaining malaria foci.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<\/ul><\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>Optimal coverage of ITNs\/LLINs or IRS should be ensured and maintained in strata that are both receptive and vulnerable to malaria transmission.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>Vector control interventions should be conducted in addition to ITNs\/LLINs and\/or IRS according to the principles of integrated vector management and evidence-based, WHO-recommended strategies.<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><\/div>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>National malaria programmes have tools (e.g. insecticides to kill vectors, methods to prevent vector\u2013human contact, diagnostics to detect infections and document clearance of infections, a variety of medicines to kill parasites in humans) and strategies to use those tools (e.g. spraying insecticides on walls or distributing ITNs\/ LLINs, managing clinical illness or proactively seeking infected people or at-risk populations to ensure clearance or prophylaxis of malaria infections). As described in <a href=\"\/node\/351\"><strong>section 6<\/strong><\/a>, new tools and strategies will become available in the future; nevertheless, even current tools and strategies can dramatically reduce the malaria disease burden and transmission; many countries have already eliminated malaria with existing tools. In order to define optimal intervention packages, current and evolving transmission intensities and the ecological and epidemiological features of the areas of a country must be understood.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"2.1 Strategies and interventions for malaria elimination","nid":251,"vid":2783,"created":1567084229,"changed":1581928612,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":44,"name":"Strategy & interventions of malaria elimination"}]}
