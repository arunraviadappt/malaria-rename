These are prerequisites for adequate allocation of funds to the malaria programme to ensure continuing activities, including diagnostic, treatment and surveillance capacity. Funding will also ensure that the supply chain is fully operational and malaria commodities are available at all times, with proper management of safety stocks of essential medicines for diseases that occur at low incidence.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"4.2 Maintaining a strong health system","nid":335,"vid":2857,"created":1567503961,"changed":1581944928,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":40,"name":"Prevention of re-establishment"}]}
