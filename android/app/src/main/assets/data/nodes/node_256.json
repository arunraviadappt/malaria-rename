{"body":"<p>All programmes for malaria elimination should establish and maintain their capacity to conduct IRS for rapid clearance of transmission foci and as an adjunct or targeted control measure, even where ITNs\/LLINs are the core vector control strategy, especially in areas in which the vectors are resistant to pyrethroids. A significant advantage of IRS for the containment of malaria foci is that it does not require human behavioural change, except when people refuse access to their houses or re-plaster their walls soon after spraying; such problems can sometimes be solved by using a more acceptable insecticide. Unlike ITNs\/LLINs, which remain effective during several transmission seasons, IRS may be effective for only two to six months, depending on the insecticide formulation and spray surface.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Failure to achieve high coverage and high-quality implementation of either ITNs\/LLINs or IRS should not be compensated by adding the other intervention <em><a href=\"\/node\/364\">(5)<\/a><\/em>. Continued use of ITNs\/LLINs is recommended even in areas where vectors are moderately resistant to the ITN\/LLIN insecticide. In areas with vectors resistant to pyrethroids, where ITNs\/LLINs are the primary intervention, IRS with application in rotation of different classes of insecticide should be used to manage resistance <em><a href=\"\/node\/364\">(21)<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n","title":"2.3.1.2 IRS","nid":256,"vid":2737,"created":1567084874,"changed":1580284850,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":44,"name":"Strategy & interventions of malaria elimination"}]}
