{"body":"<p>As for control programmes, monitoring (systematic tracking of programme actions over time, including budget allocations and adherence to standard operating procedures) and evaluation (examining progress and its determinants) are essential for measuring how well an elimination programme is operating over time and whether it is achieving its milestones and goals. In the context of \u201cscale-up for impact\u201d, monitoring and evaluation consist of evaluating the reduction in burden. As transmission is reduced, however, monitoring and evaluation with strong surveillance systems (see<a href=\"\/node\/291\"> <strong> section 2.6.6<\/strong><\/a>) should consist of detecting infections and measuring transmission dynamics <a href=\"\/node\/364\"><em>(12)<\/em><\/a>. A detailed monitoring and evaluation plan should include a manageable set of the most important indicators, determined according to programme goals and interventions used. While the coverage indicators used in control programmes remain useful, some will have to be adapted and new indicators introduced. Some recommended indicators for elimination programmes are listed in <a href=\"\/node\/370\"><strong> Annex 3<\/strong><\/a>. Planning of monitoring and evaluation should include the sources of data that will be used to measure the indicators, how and when metrics will be reported and how the programme will verify the accuracy of reported information and ensure accountability for timely, complete reporting.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"3.2.1 Monitoring and evaluation","nid":308,"vid":2834,"created":1567501648,"changed":1581943691,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":44,"name":"Strategy & interventions of malaria elimination"}]}
