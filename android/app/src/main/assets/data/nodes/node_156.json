{"body":"<p>The sensitivity of P. <em>vivax<\/em> to antimalarial drugs must be monitored in order to improve the treatment of vivax malaria, in particular in view of its emerging resistance to chloroquine. A modified version of the standard WHO in-vitro test for determining the antimalarial sensitivity of P. <em>falciparum<\/em> has been used successfully for assessing the sensitivity of P. <em>vivax<\/em> populations and for screening the efficacy of new antimalarial drugs (35\u201337). WHO recently introduced a revised protocol for in- vivo monitoring of the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine in P. <em>vivax<\/em> malaria, which includes measurement of blood chloroquine levels to assess exposure, and use of molecular markers (only available for the <em>Pvdhfr<\/em> gene). Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying drug resistance in P. <em>vivax<\/em> is needed to improve monitoring of chloroquine resistance.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"A6.4 Monitoring therapeutic efficacy","nid":156,"vid":1480,"created":1566388759,"changed":1573198379,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null}
