{"body":"<p>An elimination programme will require a short-term infusion of funding to intensify activities and a commitment to longer-term funding to ensure continued surveillance and control even after malaria has been eliminated, to prevent reintroduction and resurgence.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>An increase in the overall malaria budget may also be necessary to achieve programme goals. All objectives in the strategic plan should be costed in detail to inform the resource mobilization strategy, which should include both advocating for increased domestic contributions and applying for external funds. Traditional and new donors in the public and private sectors should be targeted, and innovative financing mechanisms to expand the donor base should be explored. Domestic financing may be more sustainable, especially as malaria transmission is reduced; this is recommended where possible.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"3.1.3 Resource mobilization","nid":300,"vid":2832,"created":1567148350,"changed":1581943589,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":44,"name":"Strategy & interventions of malaria elimination"}]}
