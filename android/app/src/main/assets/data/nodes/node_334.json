{"body":"<p>In malaria-free countries or areas, malaria awareness should be maintained in the local population by various educational programmes or campaigns. Opportunities to include messages about malaria into communications in other vector-borne disease programmes or campaigns should be considered.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>To limit the consequences of malaria importation, immigrants, travellers and other groups arriving from malaria-endemic areas should benefit from early detection, quality-assured diagnosis, effective treatment and follow-up, with detailed epidemiological investigation of malaria cases. People with malaria who are planning to stay for some time or live in area with high receptivity may be provided with preventive measures such as ITNs\/LLINs.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Migrant workers and travellers exposed to malaria may receive diagnostic testing and treatment of symptoms at health centres, ideally free of charge. Likewise, prophylaxis should be distributed for free to local people travelling to endemic places, or, at the least, they should be informed of malaria prevention measures. At points of entry, immigrants from malaria-endemic countries or areas should be given printed materials on malaria, including information about what to do in case of suspected malaria.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"4.1.2.2 Reducing and mitigating vulnerability","nid":334,"vid":2856,"created":1567503808,"changed":1581944901,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":40,"name":"Prevention of re-establishment"}]}
