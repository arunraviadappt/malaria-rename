{"body":"<p>Use of the term \u201csubnational certification\u201d of malaria elimination should be avoided and the term \u201csubnational verification\u201d be used instead. Subnational verification is led by countries, which assess malaria elimination in subnational areas at their discretion.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>WHO can provide technical assistance to Member States, as for other aspects of malaria control and elimination. In particular, WHO can provide advice on the approach to be used; however, WHO does not have the resources to participate in verification in all countries. The processes and criteria for subnational verification should follow the WHO national certification scheme, as this will result in collection of essential information and establishment of the systems and structures required for certification of national elimination. Thus, the criteria and assessment procedures used in WHO certification of national malaria elimination are valid for subnational verification.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>A clear distinction must be made between the role of national authorities, who verify, and that of local authorities in subnational areas, who are the objects of verification.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"5.4.1 General principles for interested countries","nid":349,"vid":2870,"created":1567505878,"changed":1581946122,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":41,"name":"Certification of elimination"}]}
