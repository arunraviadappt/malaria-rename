{"body":"<p>ITNs\/LLINs and IRS are core interventions for reducing the human biting rate and vector survival, which significantly reduce vectorial capacity and transmission. ITNs\/LLINs provide protection for the occupants of houses against biting malaria mosquitoes by killing them before they can take a blood meal, whereas IRS kills mosquitoes that rest indoors after they have taken a blood meal.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>While the effectiveness of both these interventions is maximal with high coverage and use, their impact is temporary and depends on their maintenance. Premature withdrawal of ITNs\/LLINs and IRS can result in a rebound of malaria transmission to pre-existing levels (see<strong> <a href=\"\/node\/261\"> section 2.3.4<\/a><\/strong>).<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Optimal coverage of ITNs\/LLINs or IRS should be maintained in strata that are both receptive and vulnerable to malaria transmission. The receptivity of an area is not static but is affected by determinants such as environmental and climate factors. The many anopheline vectors around the world differ in the efficiency with which they transmit malaria. Thus, some, such as the nocturnal indoor-biting and indoorresting mosquitoes in sub-Saharan Africa, are more amenable to control by indoor interventions. Earlier and\/or outdoor biting and resting anophelines in other continents may be less so, although some will enter houses and be killed by the interventions. Thus, ITNs\/LLINs and IRS continue to be relevant both in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"2.3.1 Core vector control interventions","nid":632,"vid":3063,"created":1576662127,"changed":1582559102,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_operational_":[{"field_image":"","field_link":"","field_title":null}],"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":44,"name":"Strategy & interventions of malaria elimination"}]}
