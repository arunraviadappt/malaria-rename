{"body":"<p>Sporozoite rates and entomological inoculation rates are useful for estimating transmission intensity in settings where this information is lacking and where interventions are thought to have significantly decreased transmission. Sporozoite rates are useful for assessing the relative contribution of a particular vector species to malaria transmission, if this has not been established previously. Sporozoite rates also indicate the age structure of the vector population and, in operational research, can supplement estimates of survivorship from parity rates or ovarian dilatation to monitor the impact of interventions on transmission. The entomological inoculation rate is a measure of the intensity of malaria parasite transmission, which is the number of infective bites received per person in a given unit of time. It is generally not possible to measure sporozoite rates or entomological inoculation rates with any precision when transmission rates are very low, because of either low vector densities or low infection incidence rates.eceptivity is one component of malariogenic potential, and a number of methods have been used to assess it. WHO is evaluating available evidence and approaches in order to provide improved guidance on the appropriate approach for classifying receptivity.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"5.3.4 Proxies for transmission","nid":543,"vid":3402,"created":1573714815,"changed":1587018240,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_operational_":[{"field_image":"","field_link":"","field_title":null}],"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":43,"name":"Entomology & insecticide resistance"}]}
