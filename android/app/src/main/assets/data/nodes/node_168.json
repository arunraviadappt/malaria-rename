{"body":"<p>The spread of resistance is determined by the reproductive advantage conferred by the resistance mechanism. This results from the increased gametocyte carriage associated with resistance (both from the primary infection and from subsequent recrudescence), the \u201cdonors\u201d and the selective pressure from residual concentrations of slowly eliminated antimalarial drug in potential recipients (15).<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Resistance encoded by multiple mutations at a single locus generally occurs in two overlapping phases: in phase 1, the drug is better tolerated by the parasites, but the therapeutic doses still usually clear the infection; in phase 2, clinical failures start to occur. As the second phase is very rapid, it is essential that surveillance programmes be in place and are capable of monitoring the change from the first to the second phase. Phase 1 may occur faster in areas of high transmission, but the subsequent phase is slower. Combination therapy significantly slows the rate of evolution of resistance, but surveillance is still vital to detect early signs of resistance.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"A7.3.5 Spread of resistance","nid":168,"vid":196,"created":1566389845,"changed":1566389883,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null}
