{"body":"<p>If the population has good access to health services (public, private, nongovernmental organization or community services), the majority of cases will be identified early by PCD and treated to reduce the risks of severe disease and death and may also contribute to reducing transmission. In elimination settings, PCD should cover the whole population, including those living or working in remote areas or who are hard to reach, to ensure coverage with rapid testing, treatment and reporting.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>High-quality coverage with PCD is therefore a critical prerequisite for reducing the burden of and eliminating malaria. Programmes should map or otherwise determine whether there are communities located in receptive areas (i.e. with competent vectors, a suitable climate and a susceptible population) that are far from public health facilities and add additional health posts, CHWs or volunteers to those locations, to extend the reach of the PCD network. Optimizing PCD should be a priority of national programmes in terms of access to care and surveillance.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"3.2.1 Passive case detection","nid":384,"vid":3519,"created":1567591991,"changed":1587401589,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":38,"name":"Concepts & practice"}]}
