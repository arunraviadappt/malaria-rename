{"body":"<p>While factors that may limit the effectiveness of existing vector control interventions must be addressed, even full implementation of core interventions cannot halt malaria parasite transmission in all settings. Evidence from various areas indicates that residual malaria parasite transmission occurs even with good access to and useof ITNs\/LLINs or well-implemented IRS, as well as in situations where ITN\/LLIN use or IRS are not practical <em><a href=\"\/node\/364\">(22)<\/a><\/em>. The behaviour of both humans and vectors is responsible for residual transmission, such as when people live in or visit forest areas or do not sleep in protected houses or when local mosquito vector species have one or more characteristics that allow them to avoid the IRS and ITN\/LLIN intervention tools.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Additional vector control interventions should be practised to supplement ITNs\/LLINs and\/or IRS on the principle of integrated vector management and evidence-based, WHO-recommended strategies. Such supplementary interventions can accelerate a reduction in transmission intensity. They should be implemented concurrently with, but not in lieu of, optimal coverage with ITNs\/LLINs or IRS.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"2.3.2 Supplementary vector control strategies","nid":633,"vid":3064,"created":1576662200,"changed":1582559134,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_operational_":[{"field_image":"","field_link":"","field_title":null}],"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":44,"name":"Strategy & interventions of malaria elimination"}]}
