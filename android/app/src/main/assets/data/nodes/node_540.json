{"body":"<p>Various sampling techniques can be used to measure an indicator, the appropriateness of which depends on the density and behaviour of the vector species <em><a href=\"\/node\/455\">(44,45)<\/a><\/em>. For example, the human biting rate can be derived using a number of methods (e.g. human landing catches, human-baited traps, human odour-baited traps, CO2-baited traps and CDC light traps with a conversion; see <strong>Table 9<\/strong>). Vector preference for human hosts can then be determined by molecular or enzymatic analysis of blood-engorged mosquitoes to calculate the human blood index. In areas in which malaria vectors are endophagic and endophilic, they can be collected indoors with appropriate methods; however, in areas in which the majority of vectors exit houses after feeding (exophilic), collections of outdoor-resting mosquitoes provide the best estimate of the human blood index.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"5.3.1 Adult vector composition and behaviour","nid":540,"vid":3405,"created":1573714613,"changed":1587018276,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_operational_":[{"field_image":"","field_link":"","field_title":null}],"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":43,"name":"Entomology & insecticide resistance"}]}
