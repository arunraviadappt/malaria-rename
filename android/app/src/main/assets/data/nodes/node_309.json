{"body":"<p>Monitoring and evaluation can be compromised if poor-quality information is provided for decision-making, thus preventing programme managers from seeing programme strengths and weaknesses and reducing confidence in the data. The six components of data quality are:<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>validity: Do the data accurately reflect the intended measure?<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>reliability: Are the data collected regularly, with the same method?<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>integrity: Have the data been manipulated in some way, consciously or unconsciously?<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>precision: Are the measurements reproducible and free of excessive random error?<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>timeliness: Are data collected and reported within appropriate time lapses? This is especially important in elimination programmes, as reported data must be analysed rapidly to assess trends over time and place, particularly as transmission decreases and the distribution of cases of infection becomes increasingly focal.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>completeness: Are data missing?<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><p>Data quality can be maximized by ensuring strong, well-functioning information systems that facilitate the collection and reporting of the required information by programme staff. Procedures for reviewing data at all levels and performing regular audits of quality should be specified. Technological solutions can be helpful; for example, reporting by mobile phone can increase timeliness, while electronic data entry can minimize later transcription errors and obviate the entry of contradictory information.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"3.2.2 Data quality","nid":309,"vid":2835,"created":1567501707,"changed":1581943722,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":44,"name":"Strategy & interventions of malaria elimination"}]}
