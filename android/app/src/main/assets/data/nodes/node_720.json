{"body":"<p><strong>Larval source management (LSM)<\/strong><br \/>&#13;\nLSM in the context of malaria control is the management of water bodies that are potential larval habitats for mosquitoes. Such management of water bodies is conducted to prevent the development of the immature stages (eggs, larvae and pupae) and hence the production of adult mosquitoes, with the overall aim of preventing or controlling transmission of malaria. There are four types of LSM:\u00a0<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>habitat modification: a permanent alteration to the environment, e.g. land reclamation, filling of water bodies;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>habitat manipulation: a recurrent activity, e.g. flushing of streams, drain clearance;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>larviciding: the regular application of biological or chemical insecticides to water bodies; and<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>biological control: the introduction of natural predators into water bodies.<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><p><strong>Topical repellents, insecticide-treated clothing and spatial\/airborne repellents<\/strong><br \/>&#13;\nTopical repellents, insecticide-treated clothing and spatial\/airborne repellents have all been proposed as potential methods for preventing malaria in areas where the mosquito vectors bite or rest outdoors, or bite in the early evening or early morning when people are not within housing structures. These methods have also been proposed for specific population groups, such as those who live or work away from permanent housing structures (e.g., migrants, refugees, internally displaced persons, military personnel) or those who work outdoors at night. In these situations, the effectiveness of ITNs or IRS may be reduced. Repellents have also been proposed for use in high-risk groups, such as pregnant mothers. Despite the potential to provide individual protection against bites from malaria vectors, the deployment of the above personal protection methods in large-scale public health campaigns has been limited, at least partially due to the scarcity of evidence of their public health value. Daily compliance and appropriate use of repellents seem to be major obstacles to achieving such potential impact\u00a0<a href=\"#56\"><em>[56]<\/em><\/a>.\u00a0Individuals\u2019 use of the intervention to achieve personal protection faces the same obstacles.<br \/><br \/><strong>Space spraying<\/strong><br \/>&#13;\nSpace spraying refers to the release of fast-acting insecticides into the air as smoke or as fine droplets as a method to reduce the numbers of adult mosquitoes in dwellings and also outdoors. Application methods include thermal fogging; cold aerosol distribution by handheld or backpack sprayers, ground vehicles or aerial means; and repetitious spraying by two or more sprays in quick succession. Space spraying is most often deployed in response to epidemics or outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease, such as dengue.<br \/><br \/><strong>Housing modifications<\/strong><br \/>&#13;\nIn the context of malaria control, housing modifications are defined as any structural changes, pre- or post-construction, of a house that prevents the entry of mosquitoes and\/or decreases exposure of inhabitants to vectors with the aim of preventing or reducing the transmission of malaria. Housing modifications may encompass a wide range of interventions\u00a0\u2013 from those made at the outset in the structural design of the house and the choice of materials used, to modifications made to existing homes, such as the screening or closure of gaps. In 2018, the WHO Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health published the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/publications\/i\/item\/9789241550376\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>WHO Housing and health guidelines<\/em><\/a>\u00a0<a href=\"#56\"><em>[56]<\/em><\/a>. This document brings together the most recent evidence to provide practical recommendations for reducing the health burden due to unsafe and substandard housing. The review concluded that improved housing conditions have the potential to save lives, prevent disease, increase quality of life, reduce poverty, and help mitigate climate change. It was, however, noted that further evidence was needed on the impact of improved housing in preventing vector-borne diseases.<br \/>&#13;\n\u00a0<br \/>&#13;\nAvailable evidence indicates that poor-quality housing and neglected peri-domestic environments are risk factors for the transmission of a number of vector-borne diseases such as malaria, arboviral diseases (e.g. dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika virus disease), Chagas disease and leishmaniasis\u00a0<a href=\"#57\"><em>[57]<\/em><\/a>. Together with metal roofs, ceilings, and finished interior walls, the closing of open eaves, screening doors and windows with fly screens or mosquito netting, and filling holes and cracks in walls and roofs may reduce the mosquitoes\u2019 entry points into houses and potentially reduce transmission of malaria and other vector-borne diseases. A recent review indicated that housing quality is an important risk factor for malaria infection across the spectrum of malaria endemicity in sub-Saharan Africa\u00a0<a href=\"#58\"><em>[58]<\/em><\/a>\u00a0.\u00a0\u00a0<br \/>&#13;\n\u00a0<br \/>&#13;\nStructural housing interventions that may reduce exposure of inhabitants to mosquitoes fall largely into two categories:<br \/>&#13;\n\u00a0<br \/>&#13;\n1.
