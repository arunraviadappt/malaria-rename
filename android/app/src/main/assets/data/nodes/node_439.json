{"body":"<p>A district management team or equivalent should be established in epidemic-prone areas. The team should comprise a medical officer, an epidemiologist, an entomologist and a trained laboratory technician to verify cases in the field. In areas where coverage of parasitological diagnosis is poor, malaria is often confused with other causes of fever, and additional confirmation in the field may be required to ensure that the reported fevers are the result of malaria infections. Verification of a malaria epidemic may be combined with confirmation of other notifiable febrile diseases to ensure quick response to those diseases as well. The steps in verification of a detected malaria epidemic are:<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>rapid assessment to confirm that an unusual increase in the number of fever cases is due to malaria;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>laboratory investigation to confirm suspected cases with RDT or microscopy;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>entomological confirmation in collected larval and\/or adult mosquitoes to determine vector control measures to be implemented or whether vector control is necessary at all; and<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>immediate notification to the national emergency unit by the district or equivalent monitoring centre if the team determines that there is an epidemic.<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul>","title":"6.5.5 Verification of a malaria epidemic","nid":439,"vid":3460,"created":1567685492,"changed":1587039718,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":64,"name":"Epidemics"}]}
