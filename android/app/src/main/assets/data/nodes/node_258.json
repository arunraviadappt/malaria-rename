{"body":"<p>Larval source management consists of the management of water bodies that are potential sites for anopheline oviposition <em><a href=\"\/node\/364\">(23)<\/a><\/em> in order to reduce the production of adult vectors, either temporarily or permanently. This intervention is recommended in areas where larval habitats are \u201cfew, fixed and findable\u201d <em><a href=\"\/node\/364\">(24)<\/a><\/em>, i.e. close to houses; such conditions are likely to exist when transmission has become increasingly focal. Effective larval source management requires understanding of the ecology of larval habitat productivity and effective monitoring of both the larval and adult stages of the vector in order to determine the effectiveness of the intervention. Larval source management can be categorized as habitat modification, habitat manipulation, biological control or chemical larviciding (including the use of insect growth regulators). Use of the last three categories can temporarily reduce vectorial capacity and contribute to malaria elimination in some settings; however, permanent removal of larval habitats (habitat modification) will reduce potential re-establishment of transmission once malaria has been eliminated, by permanently reducing the density of the vector population and proportionally reducing vectorial capacity. Reintroduction of malaria parasites into an area with effective habitat modification will be less likely to result in local malaria transmission.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"2.3.2.1 Larval source management","nid":258,"vid":2740,"created":1567084956,"changed":1580285039,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":44,"name":"Strategy & interventions of malaria elimination"}]}
