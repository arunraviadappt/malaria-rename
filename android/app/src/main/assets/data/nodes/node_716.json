The declared interests, as per WHO regulations, were assessed by the WHO Secretariat with support from the Office of Compliance, Risk Management and Ethics as needed. WHO was of the opinion that these declarations did not constitute conflicts of interest and that the considered experts could participate in the consultations on the Guidelines subject to the public disclosure of their interests, which was conducted.<br \/><br \/>&#13;\nThe relevant declared interests are summarized as follows:<br \/><br \/>&#13;\nDr T. Burkot reported several potential conflicts of interest related to consulting payments, research support and non-monetary support, as follows: 1) consulting with Intellectual Ventures Global Good Fund (IVGGF), the non-profit arm of Intellectual Ventures Laboratory. Work was conducted from October 2014 to March 2015 through James Cook University; 2) consulting with IVGGF for a secondment in 2017 to develop a vector control strategy on mosquitoproof housing and methods to age-grade mosquitoes through James Cook University; 3) consulting with the non-profit Programme for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) in 2017 to support grant applications to evaluate new vector control tools in Africa; 4) consulting with IVGGF from 2017 to February 2018 to provide technical support on developing guidelines for testing new vector control strategies paid directly to Dr Burkot; 5) consulting with PATH from 2017 to February 2018 to provide technical advice on field trials for mosquito-proof housing products paid directly to Dr Burkot; 6) research support in a supervisory role provided to James Cook University for evaluation of a new malaria diagnostic test from October 2015 to March 2017; 7) research support in a supervisory role provided to James Cook University to undertake a malaria serologic survey in the Solomon Islands until June 2018; and, 8) non-monetary support to Vestergaard in a supervisory role to evaluate the impact of insecticide netting on malaria in Solomon Islands<br \/><br \/>&#13;\nDr M. Coetzee reported a potential conflict of interest related to a family member\u2019s consulting work with AngloGold Ashanti in 2016 to carry out mosquito surveys and determine insecticide resistance in order to inform vector control strategies by gold mining companies in Africa.<br \/>&#13;\n\u00a0<br \/>&#13;\nProfessor M. Coosemans reported receiving a grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation for studying the impact of repellents for malaria prevention in Cambodia and also reported receiving repellent products for the study from SC Johnson for work conducted in 2012\u20132014. He also reported receiving six grants for the evaluation of public health pesticides from WHOPES since 2007, some of which will continue until 2018.<br \/>&#13;\n\u00a0<br \/>&#13;\nDr J. Hii reported receiving remuneration for consulting services from WHO and from the Ministry of Health of Timor-Leste for work conducted in 2017. He reported holding a grant from SC Johnson that ceased in 2017 for the evaluation of transfluthrin, and receiving travel and accommodation support from Bayer Crop Science to attend the 4th Bayer Vector Control Expert Meeting in 2017. He reported holding a WHO\/TDR research grant that focused on studying the magnitude and identifying causes for residual transmission in Thailand and Viet Nam (completed in 2018), and reported a plan to study the impact of socio-ecological systems and resilience (SESR)-based strategies on dengue vector control in schools and neighbouring household communities in Cambodia, which in November 2017

(2021)<\/strong><br \/>&#13;\nMembers of the GDG and ERG were requested to declare any interests related to the topic of the meeting. The declared interests, as per WHO regulations, were assessed by the WHO Secretariat with support from the Office of Compliance, Risk Management and Ethics as needed.<br \/><br \/>&#13;\nThe relevant declared interests for the GDG are summarized as follows:<br \/><br \/>&#13;\nLUCY TUSTING: It was determined that Dr Tusting could participate in all parts of the meeting except for decision-making with respect to recommendations related to housing improvements.<br \/><br \/>&#13;\nThe relevant declared interests for the ExRG are summarized as follows:<br \/><br \/>&#13;\nUMBERTO D\u2019ALLESSANDRO: the declared interests regarding the renumeration for acting on the advisory board, travel and the value of the donated drugs were considered financially significant, however the subject of these interests are not related to the topics of the review. The projects associated with housing modifications or improvements (2 to 4) are related to the subject of discussion. However, as the remit of the ERG is limited to identifying factual errors, providing clarity and to comment on implications for implementation -not to change the recommendations formulated by the GDG - it was concluded that his contributions would be valuable given his vast field experience.<br \/><br \/>&#13;\nJENNIFER ARMISTEAD: The declared interests were considered financially significant. Projects 1 and 2 are not related to the subject of the review, and the 4<sup>th<\/sup>\u00a0project evaluates larviciding which, although part of larval source management, is not an intervention for which revisions are being made in the vector control guidelines. The project associated with housing modifications (3) is related to the subject of discussion.\u00a0 However, as reviewers are not asked to change the meaning of the recommendations themselves, it was concluded that her contributions would be valuable particularly in commenting on uptake of the recommendations as she has vast field implementation experience.<br \/><br \/>&#13;\nMAUREEN COETZEE: The declared interests regarding the funding provided were considered financially significant. Project 3 investigated housing characteristics that were associated with risk of mosquito biting but did not evaluate the impact of housing modifications on malaria. Given her vast field experience, it was concluded that her review of the vector control guidelines would be valuable especially in commenting on implications for implementation.<br \/><br \/>&#13;\nCAROLINE JONES: Endectocides and vaccines are not topics of discussion for this review and so these projects are not considered a potential conflict of interest. The second project above aims to investigate the factors limiting the efficacy of current tools to prevent malaria, largely insecticide-treated nets, and identify the most cost effective, complementary interventions that would drive malaria transmission towards zero. This project could consider interventions under discussion by the ExRG but does not seek to systematically evaluate a particular tool. The third project is linked to one of the subjects being discussed as part of the review.\u00a0 As with Prof D\u2019Alessandro and Prof Coetzee, because the review is limited to identifying factual errors and commenting on clarity and implementation of the recommendations, it was felt that Dr Jones can provide useful insight regarding factors to be considered associated with gender and social determinants, equity, and human rights.<br \/><br \/>&#13;\nNEIL LOBO: The declared interests regarding the funding provided and provision of research materials were considered financially significant. None of the projects where companies had provided support were deemed to be related to the subject of the review. Only the topic of research project 7, \u2018Screening mosquito entry points into houses with novel long lasting insecticidal netting to reduce indoor vector densities and mitigate pyrethroid resistance\u2019 was considered to be related to the subject of the review.\u00a0 As the ExRG will not be asked to comment on the recommendations themselves, rather just ensure the wording is clear, accurate and supports uptake by end-users, it was felt that Prof Lobo would provide useful review given his vast experience working with national programmes.<br \/><br \/>&#13;\nMELANIE RENSHAW: Whilst the amount received was deemed significant, the nature of her work does not address the topics under review specifically so does not represent a conflict of interest.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"10.1 Guidelines for malaria vector control","nid":716,"vid":4103,"created":1620202766,"changed":1624962520,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_operational_":[{"field_image":"","field_link":"","field_title":null}],"field_recommendations":1,"recommendation":"<p>All cases of suspected malaria should have a parasitological test (microscopy or Rapid diagnostic test (RDT)) to confirm the diagnosis.<br \/>\r\nBoth microscopy and RDTs should be supported by a quality assurance programme.<br \/>\r\n<font color=\"#4090CF\"><em>Good practice statement<\/em><\/font><\/p>\r\n","recommendation_title":"Rapid diagnostic test (RDT)","field_references":null}
