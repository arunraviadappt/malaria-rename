{"body":"<p>As part of the GTS pillar \u201c<em>Accelerate efforts towards elimination and attainment of malaria-free status<\/em>\u201d, component C refers to the speed at which universal coverage with core malaria interventions is achieved for at-risk populations and at which surveillance systems generate detailed, dynamic information. Depending on the local context, component C may also include deployment of additional, timely, efficient interventions to reduce transmission intensity to sufficiently low levels that the few remaining infections can be found, treated and cleared as soon as they arise.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Possible means of acceleration include strategies such as population-wide parasite clearance by mass drug administration, which is currently recommended for consideration in areas approaching elimination <em><a href=\"\/node\/364\">(9)<\/a><\/em>, and potential strategies such as additional vector control and vaccines, if and when they become available. Decisions to use such means of acceleration are made for each location after careful assessment of factors such as transmission intensity and system readiness (see <a href=\"\/node\/293\"><strong>section-2.7<\/strong><\/a> for more information).<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"1.2.3 Component C: Accelerating transmission reduction","nid":248,"vid":2729,"created":1567081918,"changed":1580228713,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_references":null}
