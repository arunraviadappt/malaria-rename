The interventions currently recommended by WHO for the control of malaria are\u00a0insecticide-treated nets or indoor residual spraying for vector control, prompt access to diagnostic testing of suspected malaria and treatment of confirmed cases. SMC is defined as the intermittent administration of full treatment courses of an antimalarial medicine during the malaria season to prevent illness, with the objective of maintaining therapeutic antimalarial drug concentrations in the blood throughout the period of greatest risk.<\/p><p>SMC is therefore recommended in areas of highly seasonal malaria transmission throughout the Sahel subregion. A complete treatment course of amodiaquine + SP should be given to children aged 3\u201359 months at monthly intervals, beginning at the start of the transmission season, and continuing until\u00a0its end (usually three or four months), provided the drugs retain sufficient antimalarial efficacy when used as SMC.<br \/><br \/>The results of clinical trials indicate that a high level of protection against uncomplicated clinical malaria is likely to be maintained for 4 weeks after administration of each course of amodiaquine + SP; thereafter, protection appears to decay rapidly.<br \/><br \/>Treatment of breakthrough <i>P. falciparum <\/i>infections during the period of SMC should not include either amodiaquine or SP, and, in areas where SMC is implemented, alternative antimalarial combinations containing neither amodiaquine nor SP must be made available for the treatment of clinical malaria in the target age group.<br \/><br \/>IPTi and SMC should not be administered concomitantly; therefore, IPTi should not be used in target areas for SMC. SMC should not be given to children with severe acute illness or who are unable to take oral medication, or to HIV-positive children receiving co-trimoxazole, or children who have received a dose of either amodiaquine or SP during the past month or children with allergy to either drug.<br \/><br \/>Please refer to the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/publications\/i\/item\/9789241504737\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <i>Seasonal malaria chemoprevention with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine in children: A field guide<\/i><\/a><i>\u00a0<\/i><cite class=\"magic-cite\" data-ref-id=\"362703\" data-label=\"\">[86]<\/cite>.<\/p>","field_icon":null}],"field_header":"In areas with highly seasonal"}],"field_content_type":{"tid":9,"name":"Accord","class":"accord"},"field_left_right_navigation":1,"field_operational_":[{"field_image":"","field_link":"","field_title":null}],"field_recommendations":1,"recommendation":"<p>All cases of suspected malaria should have a parasitological test (microscopy or Rapid diagnostic test (RDT)) to confirm the diagnosis.<br \/>\r\nBoth microscopy and RDTs should be supported by a quality assurance programme.<br \/>\r\n<font color=\"#4090CF\"><em>Good practice statement<\/em><\/font><\/p>\r\n","recommendation_title":"Rapid diagnostic test (RDT)","field_recommendation_api_url":"https:\/\/api.magicapp.org\/api\/v1\/recommendations\/?sectionId=78093","field_references":null,"field_tags":[{"tid":67,"name":"Recommendations for preventive chemotherapies"},{"tid":52,"name":"Seasonal malaria chemoprevention"}]}
