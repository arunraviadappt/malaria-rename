{"body":"<p>Individual patients derive the maximum benefit from an ACT if they can access it within 24\u201348 h of the onset of malaria symptoms. The impact in reducing transmission at a population level depends on high coverage rates and the transmission intensity. Thus, to optimize the benefits of deploying ACTs, they should be available in the public health delivery system, the private sector and the community, with no financial or physical barrier to access. A strategy for ensuring full access (including community management of malaria in the context of integrated case management) must be based on analyses of national and local health systems and may require legislative changes and regulatory approval, with additional local adjustment as indicated by programme monitoring and operational research. To optimize the benefits of effective treatment, wide dissemination of national treatment guidelines, clear recommendations, appropriate information, education and communication materials, monitoring of the deployment process, access and coverage, and provision of adequately packaged antimalarial drugs are needed.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"Introduction","nid":626,"vid":2418,"created":1576660439,"changed":1576660473,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content","class":"content"},"field_operational_":[{"field_image":"","field_link":"","field_title":null}],"field_references":null}
