[{"nid":134,"text_data":"14.4.1 Choosing a diagnostic strategy  The two methods currently considered suitable for routine patient management are light microscopy and RDTs. Different strategies may be adopted in different health care settings. The choice between RDTs and microscopy depends on local circumstances, including the skills available, the patient case-load, the epidemiology of malaria and use of microscopy for the diagnosis of other diseases. When the case-load of patients with fever is high, the cost of each microscopy test is likely to be less than that of an RDT; however, high-throughput, high-quality microscopy may be less operationally feasible. Although several RDTs allow diagnosis of both P.  falciparum  and P.  vivax  infections, microscopy has further advantages, including accurate parasite counting (and thus identification of high parasite density), prognostication in severe malaria, speciation of other malaria parasites and sequential assessment of the response to antimalarial treatment. Microscopy may help to identify other causes of fever. High-quality light microscopy requires well- trained, skilled staff, good staining reagents, clean slides and, often, electricity to power the microscope. It requires a quality assurance system, which is often not well implemented in malaria-endemic countries.  In many areas, malaria patients are treated outside the formal health services, e.g. in the community, at home or by private providers. Microscopy is generally not feasible in the community, but RDTs might be available, allowing access to confirmatory diagnosis of malaria and the correct management of febrile illnesses.  The average sensitivity of HRP2-detecting RDTs is generally greater than that of RDTs for detecting pLDH of P.  falciparum , but the latter are slightly more specific because the HRP2 antigen may persist in blood for days or weeks after effective treatment. HRP2-detecting RDTs are not suitable for detecting treatment failure. RDTs are slightly less sensitive for detecting P.  malariae  and P.  ovale . The WHO Malaria RDT Product Testing programme provides comparative data on the performance of RDT products to guide procurement. Since 2008, 210 products have been evaluated in five rounds of product testing.\u00b9\u2077,\u00b9\u2078  For the diagnosis of severe malaria, microscopy is preferred, as it provides a diagnosis of malaria and assessment of other important parameters of prognostic relevance in severely ill patients (such as parasite count and stage of parasite development and intra-leukocyte pigment). In severe malaria, an RDT can be used to confirm malaria rapidly so that parenteral antimalarial treatment can be started immediately. Where possible, however, blood smears should be examined by microscopy, with frequent monitoring of parasitaemia (e.g. every 12 h) during the first 2\u20133 days of treatment in order to monitor the response. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00b9\u2077 Malaria rapid diagnostic test performance.

Prescribers, shopkeepers and vendors should therefore give clear, comprehensible explanations of how to use the medicines. Co-formulation probably contributes importantly to adherence. User- friendly packaging (e.g. blister packs) also encourages completion of a treatment course and correct dosing. \u00a0"},{"nid":149,"text_data":"A6.1 Introduction    Plasmodium  vivax accounts for approximately half of all malaria cases outside Africa (1\u20133). It is prevalent in the Middle East, Asia, the Western Pacific and Central and South America. With the exception of the Horn, it is rarer in Africa, where there is a high prevalence of the Duffy-negative phenotype, particularly in West Africa, although cases are reported in both Mauritania and Mali (3). In most areas where P. vivax is prevalent, the malaria transmission rates are low (except on the island of New Guinea). Affected populations achieve only partial immunity to this parasite, and so people of all ages are at risk for P.  vivax  malaria (3). Where both P.  falciparum  and P.  vivax  are prevalent, the incidence rates of P.  vivax  tend to peak at a younger age than for P.  falciparum . This is because each P. vivax inoculation may be followed by several relapses. The other human malaria parasite species, P. malariae and P. ovale (which is in fact two sympatric species), are less common. P. knowlesi, a simian parasite, causes occasional cases of malaria in or near forested areas of South-East Asia and the Indian subcontinent (4). In parts of the island of Borneo, P. knowlesi is the predominant cause of human malaria and an important cause of severe malaria.  Of the six species of  Plasmodium  that affect humans, only P.  vivax  and the two species of P.  ovale  (5) form hypnozoites, which are dormant parasite stages in the liver that cause relapse weeks to years after the primary infection. P.  vivax  preferentially invades reticulocytes, and repeated illness causes chronic anaemia, which can be debilitating and sometimes life-threatening, particularly in young children (6). Recurrent vivax malaria is an important impediment to human and economic development in affected populations. In areas where P.  falciparum  and P.  vivax  co-exist, intensive malaria control often has a greater effect on P.  falciparum , as P.  vivax , is more resilient to interventions.  Although P.  vivax  has been considered to be a benign form of malaria, it may sometimes cause severe disease (7). The major complication is anaemia in young children. In Papua province, Indonesia (7), and in Papua New Guinea (8), where malaria transmission is intense, P.  vivax  is an important cause of malaria morbidity and mortality, particularly in young infants and children. Occasionally, older patients develop vital organ involvement similar to that in severe and complicated P.  falciparum  malaria (9, 10). During pregnancy, infection with P.  vivax , as with P.  falciparum , increases the risk for abortion and reduces birth weight (11, 12). In primigravidae, the reduction in birth weight is approximately two thirds that associated with P.  falciparum . In one large series, this effect increased with successive pregnancies (11).  P.  knowlesi  is a zoonosis that normally affects long- and pig-tailed macaque monkeys. It has a daily asexual cycle, resulting in a rapid replication rate and high parasitaemia. P.  knowlesi  may cause a fulminant disease similar to severe falciparum malaria (with the exception of coma, which does not occur) (13, 14). Co-infection with other species is common."},{"nid":150,"text_data":"A6.2 Diagnosis  Diagnosis of P.  vivax , P.  ovale , and P.  malariae  malaria is based on microscopy. P.  knowlesi  is frequently misdiagnosed under the microscope, as the young ring forms are similar to those of P.  falciparum , the late trophozoites are similar to those of P.  malariae , and parasite development is asynchronous. Rapid diagnostic tests based on immunochromatographic methods are available for the detection of P.  vivax  malaria; however, they are relatively insensitive for detecting P.  malariae  and P.  ovale  parasitaemia. Rapid diagnostic antigen tests for human  Plasmodium  species show poor sensitivity for P.  knowlesi  infections in humans with low parasitaemia (15)."},{"nid":152,"text_data":"A6.3.1 Treatment of p. vivax malaria      Blood-stage infection       P.  vivax  is highly sensitive to artemisinin derivatives, which clear parasitaemia and resolve symptoms very rapidly (16). Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is therefore rapidly effective (17\u201320). All the currently recommended ACT is all highly effective against P.  vivax  malaria, with the exception of artesunate + sulfadoxine\u2013pyrimethamine in some areas (because of resistance to sulfadoxine\u2013 pyrimethamine). Thus, ACTs may be used to treat the blood stage of all malarias. Chloroquine remains an effective treatment for vivax malaria in many areas, but in others susceptibility has declined. In Oceania and Indonesia, high-level resistance of P.  vivax  to chloroquine is prevalent (21).  Tropical P.  vivax  usually relapses around 3 weeks after the start of treatment and thereafter at 3-week intervals. This is the pattern seen after treatment with quinine or an artemisinin derivative only (22), but, after treatment with chloroquine or other slowly eliminated antimalarial drugs, the first relapse is suppressed by the residual drug levels. As a result, the first relapse is delayed and typically presents 5\u20136 weeks after the start of treatment. Chloroquine, piperaquine, and mefloquine\u00a0reliably suppress this first relapse. The more rapidly eliminated amodiaquine and lumefantrine (in ACT) provide less relapse suppression, and therefore relapses occur earlier after these treatments. Whether the total number of relapses is reduced by slowly eliminated antimalarial drugs remains to be determined.      Prevention of relapse      The radical curative efficacy of primaquine varies geographically (23), although there is no evidence for acquired resistance. The frequent-relapsing tropical strains prevalent in South-East Asia and Oceania require a higher primaquine dose for radical cure than strains found elsewhere. Failure of standard primaquine therapy (15 mg daily for 14 days; 0.25 mg\/kg bw per day; total dose, 3.5 mg base\/kg bw) to prevent relapse has since been reported in Oceania, South-East Asia, the Americas and on occasion in other locations. Because adherence (and often drug quality) were not confirmed in most of these studies, all these reports may not represent failure of the 0.25-mg\/kg bw per day primaquine regimen. A systematic review of 87 clinical trials of primaquine dosing and relapse in vivax malaria, with data for 59 735 patients enrolled in 156 treatment arms, conducted in 20 countries, was reported recently (24). The median rate of recurrence after a very low dose (total dose, \u2264 2.5 mg\/kg bw) primaquine in44 studies was 25% (range, 0\u201390%) at 4\u20136 months, while that in 82 studies with a dose of &gt; 2.5 to \u2264 5 mg\/kg bw was 6.7% (range, 0\u201359%). High-dose (&gt; 5 mg\/kg bw) primaquine regimens (assessed in 28 treatment arms) were associated with a median recurrence rate of 0% (range, 0\u201315%) at 1 month. In 18 studies with control arms, the effectiveness of a very low-dose regimen of primaquine was no different from that in patients who did not receive primaquine (odds ratio,0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33\u20131.09, p=0.09), whereas a significant benefit of the low-dose regimens was reported in 50% (6\/12) of studies (overall odds ratio,0.14; 95% CI, 0.06\u20130.35, p&lt;0.001). Two studies of a total of 171 patients showed much greater effectiveness of high- dose primaquine than a control (odds ratio,0.03; 95% CI, 0.01\u20130.13; p&lt;0.0001). Figure A6.1 illustrates these findings.    Figure A6.1. Forest plots showing effectiveness of different doses of primaquine in radical cure of vivax malaria. Very low dose = total dose, \u2264 2.5 mg\/kg bw, low dose = &gt; 2.5 to \u2264 5 mg\/kg bw, high dose = &gt; 5 mg\/kg bw.         In addition there was a higher risk for relapse after standard primaquine therapy (equivalent to 15 mg daily) among people weighing &gt; 70 kg. Thus, it is recommended that a higher dose regimen (0.5 mg base\/kg bw; total, 7 mg\/kg bw over 14 days) be given in South-East Asia and Oceania, where tropical frequent-relapse strains are prevalent. Elsewhere, where relapse rates are lower, the lower dose is effective and therefore recommended (0.25 mg base\/kg bw; total, 3.5mg\/kg bw over 14 days).    Figure A6.2. Dose\u2013response relations for the radical curative efficacy of primaquine in Thailand (22). P. vivax recurrence (presumed relapse) within 28 days of regimens of artesunate and different durations of primaquine (30 mg base per day) to adults is shown. The grey circle shows the recurrences in adults receiving artesunate and primaquine at 60 mg daily for 7 days. The blue-centred black diamond show the rates with primaquine alone. The difference between primaquine at 30 mg\/day with and without artesunate reflects recrudescence (A; arrowed) and that between primaquine at 30 mg\/ day with artesunate and primaquine at 60 mg\/day presumably reflects relapses (B; arrowed).         An important question is whether the current 14-day primaquine regimen can be shortened. Seven-day regimens are used commonly in the Americas. Pukrittayakamee et al. (22) compared different durations of treatment for vivax malaria in Thailand and showed that a 30-mg adult dose given twice daily for 7 days (n = 43) was not inferior to the standard 14-day course of 30 mg\/day once daily (n = 42) and was not associated with a greater incidence of adverse effects (Figure 6.2). Durand et al. (25) evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine regimes\u20140.5 mg\/kg bw per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg\/kg bw per day for 7 days (210 mg total) or 0.25 mg\/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total)\u2014to prevent P. vivax malaria relapses in Loreto, Peru. Each group consisted of 180 patients; 90% completed follow-up. The relapse rates were similar with the 7- and 14-day regimes (16\/156 = 10.3% and 22\/162 = 13.6%, p = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48\/169 = 28.4%, p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). More information is needed on the tolerability, safety and efficacy of this approach. Primaquine is metabolized via cytochrome P450 mixed function oxidases (principally 2D6) to reactive intermediates, which mediate radical curative efficacy and haemolytic toxicity. Patients with loss-of- function polymorphisms in CYP2D6 may not generate sufficient metabolites for efficacy and may have relapses despite full adherence to primaquine radical curative regimens. As primaquine also has weak but significant activity against blood-stage parasites (16), the radical cure regimen of chloroquine and primaquine for vivax malaria conforms to the definition of combination therapy. Combinations of chloroquine and primaquine may therefore mask low-level chloroquine resistance.    Assessment of resistance    As P. vivax cannot be cultured continuously in vitro, it is more difficult to determine its in-vitro sensitivity to antimalarial drugs (although short-term cultures do provide reliable results). In-vivo assessment of the therapeutic efficacy of drugs against P. vivax malaria is compounded by difficulties in distinguishing recrudescence due to drug-resistant infections from relapse. Recurrence occurring within 16 days of starting treatment for a primary infection is almost certainly recrudescence and thus represents therapeutic failure. A recurrence between days 17 and 28 may be either a recrudescence due to chloroquine-resistant parasites or a relapse; however, a relapse or a newly acquired infection should still be suppressed by residual chloroquine levels within 28 days. Beyond day 28, recurrences are increasingly likely to represent relapses or newly acquired infections (26). Recurrent vivax parasitaemia in the presence of chloroquine blood levels &gt; 100 ng\/mL is likely to represent resistance, whatever the origin of the recurrence."},{"nid":153,"text_data":"A6.3.2 Treatment of severe and complicated vivax or knowlesi malaria  P.  vivax  and P.  knowlesi  are very sensitive to artemisinin derivatives (14, 16).

A single study in Indonesia reported resistance of  P .  malariae  to chloroquine (27). The recommended treatment for radical cure of  P.   ovale  relapsing malaria is the same as that for  P. vivax , i.e. ACT or chloroquine combined with primaquine (total dose, 3.5 mg base\/kg bw). The high prevalence of G6PD deficiency in areas endemic for  P .  ovale  indicates that caution should be exercised in use of primaquine, as stated below.  P .  malariae  and  P. knowlesi  do not form hypnozoites and so do not require radical cure with primaquine."},{"nid":155,"text_data":"A6.3.4 Adverse effects and contraindications  Chloroquine is generally well tolerated. Common side-effects include mild dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and itching, and dosing of primaquine is limited by abdominal discomfort at doses &gt; 1 mg\/kg bw. In general, primaquine is well tolerated at individual doses \u2264 0.5 mg base\/kg bw if given with food. Some methaemoglobinaemia is common but is very seldom dangerous. The main adverse effect of primaquine is oxidant haemolysis, which can be severe, resulting in haemoglobinuria (\u201cblackwater\u201d) and severe anaemia. Although some red cell loss may occur in normal subjects, patients who are G6PD deficient are particularly vulnerable. G6PD deficiency is very common, with a prevalence typically ranging from 3% to 35% in tropical areas (Figure A6.3). There are over 180 genetic G6PD variants, nearly all conferring an unstable enzyme, which degrades more rapidly than the normal variant. This renders older red cells vulnerable to oxidant damage (28). G6PD is X-linked; thus, males have only one G6PD allele (they are either normal or deficient hemizygotes), whereas females have two (so can be homozygous G6PD normal, homozygous G6PD deficient or heterozygous). Hemizygous males and homozygous females have full expression of G6PD deficiency: the level of G6PD activity in their mature red cells is nearly always 15% of normal or less. Heterozygous females usually have only partial deficiency, and they have been referred to as having \u201cintermediate\u201d deficiency, although, because X-inactivation is a random event that takes place early in embryonic life (termed Lyonization), the proportion of these two cell types is very variable. Thus, although the average ratio of G6PD-deficient to normal red cells is 50:50, some individuals may have a ratio of 70:30 or even more unequal ratios. The severity of oxidant haemolysis in heterozygous females therefore varies from that observed in hemizygous males (if the majority of their red cells are G6PD deficient) to very little haemolysis (if the majority of their red cells are G6PD normal). Importantly, if &gt; 30% of their red cells are not G6PD deficient, heterozygous females will be identified as \u201cnormal\u201d in current screening tests.  At a population level, the overall fall in haemoglobin in heterozygous females will be, on average, one half of that seen in hemizygous male and homozygous females (29, 30). From a clinical standpoint, heterozygotes with &gt; 80% G6PD normal red cells (i.e. &lt; 20% G6PD-deficient red cells) are very unlikely to develop severe haemolytic anaemia. Except in severely deficient individuals, haemolysis typically starts after 1 or 2 days of treatment (when all the remaining red cell oxidant defences have been exhausted). The extent of haemolysis with primaquine depends on the degree of G6PD deficiency and the primaquine dose. Two of the most prevalent G6PD variants represent the two ends of the severity spectrum, with the Mediterranean variant (the main variant found in Europe, West and Central Asia and northern India) being among the most severe and the African A\u2013 variant (found in sub- Saharan Africa and in African-Americans) being among the mildest (Figure A6.4). There is also substantial variation in G6PD activity among individuals with the same genotype and even within the same individual over time. With less severe G6PD variants, primaquine-induced haemolysis typically becomes evident after 1 or 2 days of exposure, when the oxidant defences of all the older erythrocytes have been depleted (29\u201331). If primaquine is continued in people with the African A\u2013 variant, haemolysis lessens and the haemoglobin concentration starts to rise again, despite further drug administration, as reticulocytes enter the circulation to replace the haemolysed cells.    Figure A6.4. Red cell survival and degree of anaemia following daily primaquine in different G6PD deficiency variants. On the left, red cell survival with different daily doses of primaquine given to adults with the African A\u2013 variant of G6PD deficiency. On the right, the average fractional fall in haemoglobin concentration by day 7 (time of the usual nadir) with daily primaquine dosing in people with four different G6PD deficiency variants.         These young red cells entering the circulation contain five times more G6PD than the oldest red cells and so are relatively resistant to the haemolytic effect. Further haemolysis does, however, occur with higher doses (31). In contrast, in the Mediterranean variant, haemolysis continues if primaquine is not stopped, and life-threatening anaemia may result. In six decades of primaquine use in approximately 200 million people, 14 deaths have been reported. If the estimate is confined to reports with known denominators, the estimated mortality rate is 1 in 621 428. All but one death occurred subsequent to multiple dosing to prevent vivax malaria relapse (32, 33).    Figure A6.5. Haemolysis following different primaquine regimens in people with A- G6PD deficiency. Weekly administration ameliorates the anaemia by allowing haematological recovery after each dose.          To reduce the risk for haemolysis of individuals who have G6PD deficiency, an intermittent primaquine regimen of 0.75 mg base\/kg bw weekly for 8 weeks can be given, under medical supervision. This regimen was safe and effective in people with the African A\u2013 genotype (34) (Figure A6.5). Although the regime has been recommended for some 50 years, relatively few studies have been conducted of its efficacy or safety.  The risk for severe haemolysis is virtually confined to G6PD-deficient individuals, which is why testing is so important (33). In non-G6PD-deficient individuals, a high dose of primaquine (30 mg\/day) has been shown to be safe and effective for both daily prophylaxis and radical treatment. Primaquine is not recommended during pregnancy or in infants &lt; 6 months, as limited data are available on its safety in these groups."},{"nid":156,"text_data":"A6.4 Monitoring therapeutic efficacy  The sensitivity of P.  vivax  to antimalarial drugs must be monitored in order to improve the treatment of vivax malaria, in particular in view of its emerging resistance to chloroquine.

WHO recently introduced a revised protocol for in- vivo monitoring of the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine in P.  vivax  malaria, which includes measurement of blood chloroquine levels to assess exposure, and use of molecular markers (only available for the  Pvdhfr  gene).

The greatest problem with antimalarial drug resistance is with  Plasmodium   falciparum . All geographical areas are affected, with the exception of Central America, and the worst affected is mainland South-East Asia, where parasites with reduced susceptibility to all the available antimalarial medicines are now prevalent. Resistance to chloroquine in P.  falciparum  has spread across most of the world and caused millions of deaths. Yet, chloroquine resistance appears to have arisen de novo and then spread on only a few occasions. In contrast, resistance to antifolate drugs and atovaquone arises frequently (e.g. antifolate resistance rose to high levels within 2 years of the initial deployment of proguanil in peninsular Malaya in 1947), and it can be induced readily in both P.  falciparum  and P.  vivax  (1). Against a background of chloroquine resistance, mefloquine resistance arose over a 6-year period on the north-west border of Thailand (2). Genetically encoded resistance to the artemisinin derivatives in P.  falciparum  has emerged recently in South-East Asia and is now affecting therapeutic responses to ACTs (3\u20135). Piperaquine resistance has begun to emerge in Cambodia. Resistance also occurs in P.  vivax ; high-level resistance to chloroquine is prevalent in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, and lower levels of resistance have been reported in several other areas of Asia and the Americas (6). Antifol resistance is also common in P.  vivax . There are very few reports of resistance in P.  malariae  or P.  ovale  (although there have also been very few studies).  Currently, there are no \u201cbedside\u201d tests for determining the susceptibility of malaria parasites to antimalarial medicines. Monitoring is therefore needed to determine geographical trends in susceptibility and the emergence and spread of drug resistance to guide treatment choices and planning."},{"nid":161,"text_data":"A7.2.1 Pharmacokinetics  The pharmacokinetic properties of antimalarial drugs vary widely in different individuals, so that infective malaria parasites may encounter very different blood concentrations of antimalarial medicines in patients who receive similar mg\/kg bw doses (Figure A7.2). Clinical characterization of resistance should therefore also include measurement of blood or plasma concentrations to distinguish true resistance from inadequate drug exposure. In the case of a prodrug (a drug that is not active in the ingested form and requires chemical conversion through metabolic processes to become pharmacologically active, such as proguanil), it is also necessary if possible to show adequate conversion to the active metabolite.    Figure A7.2 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimalarial drugs.          Shows the range of total numbers of parasites in the body (blue) and antimalarial drug concentrations in blood (red) that typically occur in adult patients after administration of a slowly eliminated antimalarial drug. When the drug is combined with an artemisinin derivative to form an ACT, the initial decrease in parasite numbers is much greater  (section A7.4)."},{"nid":162,"text_data":"A7.2.2 Levels of resistance  The main consequence of antimalarial drug resistance is treatment failure. At low levels of resistance, there are no early treatment failures, but the proportion of patients with late recrudescence increases. As the level of resistance rises, recrudescence occurs earlier and earlier, until, with high-grade resistance, eventually parasitaemia fails to clear or, worse still, continues to increase (7). Slowing of parasite clearance is an indicator of increasing resistance. In artemisinin resistance, slow parasite clearance is the main manifestation of resistance (reflecting loss of susceptibility of the ring-stage parasites) (3). Increasing rates of gametocytaemia are another important manifestation, which may precede detectable increases in treatment failure rates (8). This is an important driver of the spread of antimalarial drug resistance.  \u00a0  Antimalarial drug resistance is not the only cause of \u201ctreatment failure\u201d, which is failure to clear malaria parasitaemia or to resolve clinical symptoms despite use of an antimalarial drug at correct doses. Incorrect dosing, incomplete adherence (compliance), poor drug quality, interactions with other drugs, compromised drug absorption, vomiting of the medicine, unusual pharmacokinetics or misdiagnosis of the disease are other causes. Treatment failure is dangerous for the patient and also for the community, as it increases malaria transmission and fuels the emergence and spread of antimalarial drug resistance."},{"nid":164,"text_data":"A7.3.1 Molecular basis  The genetic events that confer antimalarial drug resistance (without seriously damaging the parasites) are spontaneous and rare. They occur independently of the drug but are then selected by the drug, which kills sensitive parasites but not resistant ones. The resistance mechanisms that have been described to date are mutations or changes in the copy number of genes related either to the drug targets (e.g.  Pfdhfr ) or to the pumps (e.g.  Pfmdr ) that affect intraparasitic concentrations of the drug. A single genetic event may be all that is required to confer resistance, or multiple unlinked events may be necessary (epistasis). P.  falciparum  parasites in South-East Asia appear constitutionally to have an increased propensity to develop drug resistance."},{"nid":165,"text_data":"A7.3.2 Development of resistance  The development of resistance can be considered in two parts: the initial rare genetic event, which produces the resistant mutant, and the subsequent selection process, in which the survival advantage in the presence of the antimalarial drug leads to preferential transmission of resistant mutants and, thus, to the spread of resistance. In the absence of the antimalarial drug, resistant mutants usually have a survival disadvantage. Provided the mutations have not gone to fixation (i.e. while wild-type parasites are still prevalent), this \u201cfitness cost\u201d of the resistance mechanism may result in a decrease in the prevalence of resistance once the selection pressure is removed. This happened in Malawi when chloroquine was withdrawn: susceptibility to chloroquine returned (9). Resistance to one drug may select for resistance to another when the mechanisms of resistance are similar (cross-resistance). There are many parallels with antibiotic resistance, particularly to anti-tuberculosis drugs, for which, as for malaria, transferable resistance genes are not involved in resistance (10, 11). In experimental models, resistance mutations can be selected without passage through the mosquito (i.e. during mitotic cell division) by exposing large numbers of malaria parasites (either in vitro, in animals or, as was done in the past, in volunteers) to sub-therapeutic drug concentrations (12). This allows growth of any spontaneously emerging resistant mutants while suppressing the majority drug-sensitive parasite population. The same factors underlie the selection of resistance in natural parasite populations. This explains why under-treatment of hyperparasitaemic individuals is such a potent source of resistance (13).  The factors that determine a propensity for antimalarial drug resistance to develop include (7, 14):    the intrinsic frequency with which the genetic changes occur: \t the degree of resistance (the rightwards shift in the concentration\u2013effect relation (Figure A7.1) conferred by the genetic change; \t the fitness cost of the resistance mechanism; \t the proportion of all transmissible infections that are exposed to the drug (selection pressure); \t the number of parasites exposed to the drug; \t the concentrations of drug to which these parasites are exposed; \t the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the antimalarial drug(s); \t individual (dosing, duration, adherence) and community patterns of drug use (quality, availability, distribution); \t the immunity profile of the community and the individual; and \t the simultaneous presence of other antimalarial drugs or substances in the blood to which the parasite is not resistant.    The emergence of resistance reflects the product of the probability of de-novo emergence (a rare event) and of subsequent spread. Because de-novo resistance arises randomly among malaria parasites, non-immune patients infected with large numbers of parasites who receive inadequate treatment (because of poor drug quality, poor adherence, vomiting of an oral treatment, etc.) are such an important source of de-novo resistance (13). This underlines the importance of correct prescribing, good adherence to prescribed drug regimens and the provision of treatment regimens that are still highly effective in hyperparasitaemic patients. Immunity provides a powerful \u201cbrake\u201d on the emergence of resistance by reducing the chances that resistant parasites can survive and spread.  The spread of resistant mutant malaria parasites is facilitated by widespread use of drugs with long elimination phases. These provide a \u201cselective filter\u201d, allowing infection by the resistant parasites, while the residual antimalarial activity prevents infection by sensitive parasites (15). Slowly eliminated drugs, such as mefloquine (terminal elimination half-life (t1\u20442\u1e9e), 2\u20133 weeks), piperaquine (t1\u20442\u1e9e 4 weeks) and chloroquine (t1\u20442\u1e9e 1\u20132 months), persist in the blood and provide a selective filter for weeks or months after drug administration has ceased."},{"nid":166,"text_data":"A7.3.3 Transmission intensity and the selection and spread of resistance  The recrudescence and subsequent transmission of an infection that has generated a de-novo resistant malaria parasite is essential for propagation of resistance (7, 16). Epidemiological studies clearly implicate low-transmission settings, where patients often have little or no immunity, as the source of drug resistance. Resistance in P.  falciparum  to chloroquine, sulfadoxine\u2013pyrimethamine, mefloquine, atovaquone and now artemisinins all originated in South-East Asia. Chloroquine and pyrimethamine resistance spread subsequently to Africa (17).  In low-transmission areas, although asymptomatic carriage is common in focal areas, a high proportion of malaria infections are symptomatic, and selection of drug resistance therefore takes place in the context of treatment. Large numbers of parasites (&gt;108 ) in an individual usually encounter antimalarial drugs at concentrations that are maximally effective. But, in some patients, for the reasons mentioned earlier, the blood concentrations of antimalarial drugs are much lower and may select for resistance. Immunity considerably reduces the emergence of resistance (7). Host defence contributes a major anti-parasitic effect, and so any spontaneously generated drug-resistant mutant malaria parasite must contend not only with the concentrations of antimalarial drug present but also with host immunity (18). This kills parasites regardless of their antimalarial resistance and reduces the probability of parasite survival (independently of drugs) at all stages of the transmission cycle. For the blood-stage infection, immunity acts in a similar way to antimalarial drugs, both to eliminate the rare de-novo resistant mutants and to stop them from being transmitted (i.e. like combination therapy). It also improves cure rates with failing drugs (i.e. drugs falling to resistance), thereby reducing the relative transmission advantage of resistant parasites (18). Even if a resistant mutant parasite does survive the initial drug treatment and multiplies, the chance that this will result in sufficient gametocytes for transmission is reduced as a result of asexual stage immunity (which reduces the multiplication rate and lowers the density at which the infection is controlled) and transmission-blocking immunity. In high-transmission settings, individuals are commonly infected with many different parasite genotypes, which increases the possibility of out-breeding of multi-genic resistance mechanisms or competition in the feeding anopheline mosquito (19). In areas of high malaria transmission, people still receive antimalarial treatment throughout their lives (often inappropriately for other febrile infections), but these \u201ctreatments\u201d are largely unrelated to the peaks of parasitaemia. This substantially reduces the probability of selecting resistant parasites."},{"nid":167,"text_data":"A7.3.4 Pharmacokinetics of antimalarial drugs and selection of resistance      Absorption and disposition      The probability of selecting a de-novo mutation depends on the degree of resistance that results from it. If a single mutation confers high-level resistance, selection occurs readily; however, resistance usually develops in a series of steps, the initial step being low-level resistance. If the range of blood concentrations achieved in a patient considerably exceeds the concentrations that result in 90% inhibition of multiplication (IC90 values) for the most resistant mutant (IC90 R), then resistance cannot be selected in the acute phase of treatment, as even the resistant mutants are prevented from multiplying. If, however, the peak concentrations are close to or below the IC90 R, resistance may be selected (20). Peak drug concentrations are determined mainly by absorption, distribution volume and dose. Several antimalarial drugs (notably lumefantrine, atovaquone and, to a lesser extent, mefloquine) are lipophilic, hydrophobic and variably absorbed (inter-individual variation in bioavailability of up to 20-fold); the distribution volumes also vary substantially among individuals. This results in considerable inter-individual variation in peak blood concentrations of the drugs (21). As a result, some patients may have very low levels despite receiving \u201ccorrect dosing\u201d (previous dosing recommendations for young children have often been too low); usually, however, under-dosing results from incorrect dosing. The main sources of under-dosing globally are incorrect self-medication, because of poor adherence to a correctly prescribed drug regimen, poor-quality drugs, uncontrolled drug availability and purchase of incorrect dose regimens, use of substandard drugs purchased in shops or markets, and incorrect administration at home (22). Quality-assured drugs, education, correct prescribing, optimized doses, good adherence and high-quality packaging and formulations therefore play major roles in preventing the emergence of antimalarial drug resistance.      Drug elimination rates       In high-transmission settings, a person who takes an antimalarial drug for symptomatic malaria exposes not only the parasites that are causing that infection but also all the newly acquired infections that emerge from the liver during the drug\u2019s elimination phase. The longer the terminal elimination half-life of the drug, the greater the exposure. Slow drug elimination is particularly relevant to the spread of resistance and is less important for de-novo selection (13, 15, 23). Some rapidly eliminated antimalarial drugs (e.g. the artemisinin derivatives) never present an intermediate concentration to infecting malaria parasites, because they are eliminated completely within the 2-day life cycle of the asexual parasite (20). Others (e.g. desethylamodiaquine, pyronaridine, mefloquine, piperaquine and chloroquine) have elimination half-lives of weeks or months and thus present a lengthy selection opportunity. Obviously, the greater the degree of resistance (i.e. the higher the IC90 R relative to the IC90 for susceptible parasites, IC90 S ), the wider is the window of selection opportunity (20). Selection occurs only during the terminal phase if prevalent parasites are inhibited by these low concentrations. As the prevalence and degree of resistance rise, these low concentrations become ineffective, and so selection no longer occurs during the terminal elimination phase. With the exception of the artemisinin derivatives, maximum antimalarial parasite reduction ratios (kill rates) do not usually exceed 1000-fold per cycle (24). Following hepatic schizogony, exposure of at least two asexual cycles (4 days) to therapeutic drug concentrations is required to eradicate the blood-stage parasites emerging from the liver (suppressive prophylaxis). As a result, rapidly eliminated drugs such as the artemisinin derivatives or quinine provide little or no selection during the elimination phase (20)."},{"nid":168,"text_data":"A7.3.5 Spread of resistance  The spread of resistance is determined by the reproductive advantage conferred by the resistance mechanism. This results from the increased gametocyte carriage associated with resistance (both from the primary infection and from subsequent recrudescence), the \u201cdonors\u201d and the selective pressure from residual concentrations of slowly eliminated antimalarial drug in potential recipients (15).  Resistance encoded by multiple mutations at a single locus generally occurs in two overlapping phases: in phase 1, the drug is better tolerated by the parasites, but the therapeutic doses still usually clear the infection; in phase 2, clinical failures start to occur. As the second phase is very rapid, it is essential that surveillance programmes be in place and are capable of monitoring the change from the first to the second phase. Phase 1 may occur faster in areas of high transmission, but the subsequent phase is slower. Combination therapy significantly slows the rate of evolution of resistance, but surveillance is still vital to detect early signs of resistance."},{"nid":169,"text_data":"A7.4 Prevention of resistance by use of combination therapy  The theory underlying combination treatment of tuberculosis, leprosy and HIV infection is well known; it also applies to malaria (7, 10, 11, 13, 21, 24). Combination therapy slows the emergence of resistance. If two drugs with different modes of action and, therefore, different resistance mechanisms are used in combination, the per-parasite probability of developing resistance to both drugs is the product of their individual per-parasite probabilities. The lower the de-novo per-parasite probability of developing resistance, the greater is the delay in the emergence of resistance.  The ideal pharmacokinetics for an antimalarial drug has been much debated. Rapid elimination ensures that the residual concentrations do not provide a selective filter for resistant parasites, but drugs with this property (if used alone) must be given for at least 7 days, and adherence to 7-day regimens is poor. In order for a combination to be effective in a 3-day regimen, the elimination half-life of at least one component must exceed 24 h. Artemisinin derivatives are particularly effective in combinations with other antimalarial drugs because of their high killing rates (parasite reduction rate, around 10 000-fold per cycle), lack of adverse effects and the absence of significant resistance outside South-East Asia (2). Combinations of artemisinin derivatives (which are eliminated very rapidly) given for 3 days with slowly eliminated drugs, such as lumefantrine, mefloquine and piperaquine, provide complete protection against the emergence of resistance to the artemisinin derivatives if adherence is good, but they do leave the slowly eliminated \u201ctail\u201d of the slowly eliminated partner unprotected (25). Resistance can arise in any parasite and could therefore arise within the residual parasites that have not yet been killed by the artemisinin derivative; however, the number of parasites exposed to the partner drug alone represents a tiny fraction (&lt; 0.00001%) of those present in an acute symptomatic infection. Furthermore, these residual parasites \u201csee\u201d relatively high levels of the partner, and, even if susceptibility is reduced, these levels may be sufficient to eradicate the infection (Figure A7.3). The long tail of low concentrations does, however, provide a selective filter for resistant parasites acquired from elsewhere and therefore contributes to the spread of resistance once it has developed. On the north-west border of Thailand, an area of low transmission where mefloquine resistance had already developed, systematic deployment of the artesunate\u2013mefloquine combination was effective in stopping resistance and also in reducing the incidence of malaria (2). In that location, the mefloquine\u2013artesunate ACT remained highly effective for 15 years, before artemisinin resistance emerged and failure rates increased again.    Figure A7.3. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ACTs.          The artesunate + mefloquine combination is shown as an example. If no artesunate is given, the number of parasites exposed to mefloquine alone is shown by the area of A; when the combination is administered for 3 days, the number of parasites exposed to mefloquine alone is shown by the area of B (100 million times fewer). Furthermore, mefloquine levels are higher (m to n) when confronting B than when confronting the same number of parasites (B1 ) if no artesunate is given (p to q). If a parasite containing a de-novo mefloquine-resistant mutation were to occur, it should still be susceptible to artesunate. Thus, the probability of selecting a resistant mutant is reduced by 100 million times, as only a maximum of 100 000 parasites are exposed to mefloquine alone after the fourth day (i.e. in the third cycle), and any artesunate-resistant parasite selected by artesunate initially would be killed by the accompanying mefloquine. As a result, the combination is more effective, reduces transmission and prevents the emergence of resistance to both drugs."},{"nid":171,"text_data":"A7.5.1 Monitoring methods      Clinical methods       The rapid spread of antimalarial drug resistance over the past few decades shows the importance of monitoring for proper management of clinical cases, early detection of changing patterns of resistance and indicating where national malaria treatment policies should be revised. Recommendations and methods for testing therapeutic efficacy in vivo are described in detail in WHO publications (26, 27). They involve assessing the outcome of treatment during a fixed period of follow- up (\u2265 28 days) to detect malaria recurrence, i.e. any reappearance of symptoms and signs of clinical malaria and\/or parasites in the blood. When possible, this is accompanied by at least one measurement of the slowly eliminated partner antimalarial drug in blood or plasma (usually on day 7 as all patients must be seen on this day in therapeutic assessments). Methods have been developed for measuring the concentrations of several antimalarial drugs in dried blood spots on filter paper, which considerably facilitates field studies (28). In endemic areas, recrudescence can be distinguished from reinfection by molecular genotyping (27).      Assessing resistance to artemisinins       Recrudescence rates are less informative in assessing resistance to artemisinins, as these drugs are given in combination. The key measure is the parasite clearance rate, which is measured from the log-linear decrease in parasite density, which occurs after a variable lag phase from the start of treatment (Figure A7.4). In-vivo methods for assessing artemisinin resistance require frequent measurement of parasite counts (at least three counts in the first 24 h) in patients with high enough parasite counts (at least 10 000\/\u03bcL), from which parasite clearance rates are derived. The result is usually expressed as the parasite clearance half-life (PCt1\/2) (29, 30). The PCt1\/2 values of fully sensitive infections are usually &lt; 3 h, whereas those of resistant infections are &gt; 5 h, although there is some overlap. The levels of artemisinin and its derivatives are usually not measured, as these drugs are eliminated rapidly and their assessment requires immediate plasma separation, centrifugation and storage at \u201370 o C (28).  Figure A7.4.  Parasite clearance curves . After a variable lag phase, parasitaemia decreases log-linearly. The slope of the linear segment gives the parasite clearance rate, from which the parasite clearance half-life (PCt1\/2) is derived. This is independent of the initial parasite density, whereas the parasite clearance time is strongly dependent on initial density. Artemisinin resistance (red profile) is associated with slowing of parasite clearance, typically to PCt1\/2 &gt; 5 h.      Laboratory methods      Other indirect methods to assess antimalarial resistance include in-vitro studies of parasite susceptibility to drugs in culture, studies of point mutations or duplications in parasite resistance genes with molecular methods and measurement of the concentrations of antimalarial drugs in blood. These provide valuable early warning signs of resistance. In-vitro tests for  P. falciparum  have been available for several decades, but there is still substantial variation in methods, analysis and performance between laboratories. In-vitro testing for  P. vivax  in fresh blood samples is still confined to research centres. In-vitro assessment of artemisinin resistance in  P. falciparum  requires testing for ring-stage susceptibility in special assays, as the results of conventional testing do not correlate well with parasite clearance rates (3).  Understanding of the molecular basis of antimalarial drug resistance has increased considerably in recent years. In many cases, multiple genetic changes are involved, but genotyping of malaria parasites (usually from a filter paper blood spot) by polymerase chain reaction can be used operationally to identify the principle genetic correlate of resistance. Reduced susceptibility to sulfadoxine\u2013pyrimethamine is predicted well as single nucleotide polymorphisms in the  Pfdhfr  and  Pfdhps  genes for  P. falciparum  and  Pvdhfr  genes, and detection of these mutations is valuable in determining resistance patterns. Polymorphisms in the chloroquine resistance transporter gene Pfcrt predict resistance to chloroquine and to a lesser extent amodiaquine, and polymorphisms in the cytochrome bc1 complex gene (cytbc1) predict resistance to atovaquone. Amplification of the wild-type Pfmdr1 gene is associated with resistance to mefloquine and to a lesser extent lumefantrine, whereas mutations in the gene are associated with resistance to chloroquine and amodiaquine. Artemisinin resistance is associated with mutations in the \u201cpropeller region\u201d of the  P. falciparum  kelch protein gene on chromosome 13 (PfK13)."},{"nid":172,"text_data":"A7.5.2 Reporting of treatment failures  Reports of treatment failure and decreased drug sensitivity have often provided an important first indication of more widespread resistance in an area. Although such evidence may be biased, it can be collected without much effort at peripheral health centres. Reports of treatment failure are particularly useful if accompanied by measurement of the level of the (slowly eliminated) antimalarial drug at the time of recurrent infection (to assess exposure) and storage of blood samples for molecular genotyping and, if possible, parasite culture. If such reports are standardized and registered, they can make a valuable contribution to national early-warning systems and facilitate cost-effective monitoring by national programmes (26)."},{"nid":222,"text_data":"Annex 2.

There are four human malaria parasite species \u2013  P. falciparum ,  P. vivax ,  P. malariae  and  P. ovale . Of the non-human malaria parasite species,  P. knowlesi  has recently been reported to infect humans in South-East Asia with increasing frequency, but there is no evidence so far of human-to-human transmission.\u00b9\u00a0Of the human malaria parasite species,  P .  falciparum  and  P. vivax  pose the greatest threat.  P. falciparum  remains the most dangerous and is responsible for the majority of malaria-related deaths. Outside sub-Saharan Africa,  P. vivax  malaria accounts for about half of malaria cases and predominates in countries that are prime candidates for elimination; the parasite accounts for more than 70% of malaria cases in countries with fewer than 5000 cases each year    (2)   . In contrast to  P. falciparum , which does not cause persistent liver-stage infection,  P. vivax  can stay dormant in the liver for many months or even years after inoculation and can cause repeated relapses. Thus, the elimination of  P. vivax  malaria is particularly challenging and may in some settings require new tools and strategies    (2)   .  Of about 515  Anopheles  species, only 30\u201340 are considered important malaria vectors. Multiple species can coexist within one geographical area, each with its own biting and resting pattern and preferred human or animal host; thus, species vary widely in their transmission efficiency and in their susceptibility to existing or potential anti-mosquito interventions. For more information on the biology of malaria, see    Annex 1.        Recent gains in malaria control     Wide-scale malaria interventions have led to major reductions in overall malaria mortality and morbidity. At the beginning of 2016, an estimated 3.2 billion people in 91 countries and territories    (3)    were at risk of infection with  Plasmodium . This reflects a remarkable change since 2000. Between 2000 and 2015, the rate of new malaria cases declined globally by an estimated 37%, and the global malaria death rate fell by 60%, with 6.2 million lives saved    (4)   .  Since 2000, 17 countries and territories have been declared no longer endemic or had zero indigenous malaria cases in 2015 ( Fig. 1 ). These are: Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Costa Rica, Georgia, Iraq, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, Oman, Paraguay, Sri Lanka, Syrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan.

Countries endemic for malaria in 2000 and in 2016         \u00a0    Global technical strategy for malaria 2016\u20132030     Building on the unprecedented progress achieved over the previous decade, WHO developed a  Global technical strategy for malaria 2016\u20132030  (GTS)    (5)   , endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2015, which sets global targets for 2030, with milestones for measuring progress in 2020 and 2025. All countries, including those with high burdens in Africa and elsewhere, will set their own national or subnational targets and will accelerate activities for eliminating malaria transmission and preventing its reestablishment. Progress towards malaria-free status is continuous: countries, subnational areas and communities are at different stages on the path to malaria elimination, and intervention packages can be tailored for use in different settings within a country.  The GTS is an overarching approach based on three pillars and two supporting elements ( Fig. 2 ) to guide the design of tailored country programmes, while  Action and   investment to defeat malaria   2016\u20132030  (6)   , developed by the RBM Partnership, builds a strong case for investment to mobilize collective action and resources for the fight against malaria.  The GTS sets the most ambitious targets since those of the Global Malaria Eradication Programme over 50 years ago: by 2030, mortality from and the incidence of malaria should be reduced by at least 90% from the levels in 2015, and malaria should be eliminated in at least 35 countries in which it was transmitted in 2015 ( Table 1 ).

The previous guidance    (1)    published in 2007 had to be revised to include  all  countries and epidemiological settings, wherever they lie along the continuum to malaria elimination, while providing updated guidance for countries or areas with moderate to very low malaria transmission.  This framework is intended primarily for national malaria programme managers. It will also inform the governments of endemic countries, partners, donor agencies and field workers about malaria elimination and how it is adapted and adopted in settings with different malaria epidemiology and health systems. \u00a0   BOX 1.

Accurate stratification of malaria transmission intensity is essential for effective targeting of interventions. In settings with high transmission, the malaria control programme usually stratifies subnational areas such as districts or provinces, sometimes by population surveys. As countries progress towards elimination, finer-scale mapping is required, and stratification should be more specific, ideally at the level of localities or health facility catchment areas    (11,12)   . Accurate local stratification requires reliable case detection through a surveillance system in which health facilities routinely receive reports of confirmed malaria cases at specified intervals (weekly, monthly)    (13)   .  As described below and in greater detail in    section 2   , stratification involves classification of geographical units according to their current transmission intensity and, once transmission intensity has been reduced, according to their vulnerability and receptivity to malaria, i.e. the risk for importation of malaria cases and the inherent potential of their vector-human ecosystem to transmit malaria.  Transmission intensity is usually assessed as the incidence of cases or the prevalence of infection. Most countries have information on the annual parasite incidence\u00b2\u00a0(numberof new parasitologically confirmed malaria cases per 1000 population per year) from routine surveillance and\/or on the parasite prevalence from surveys, often conducted during or just after periods of peak transmission.  The following categories of transmission intensity are indicative and meant to provide an adaptable framework in which each country can conduct a stratification exercise to classify geographical units according to local malaria transmission (see    section 2.2   ).    Areas of  high transmission  are characterized by an annual parasite incidence of about 450 or more cases per 1000 population and a  P. falciparum  prevalence rate of \u226535%.\u00b3 \t   Moderate transmission  areas have an annual parasite incidence of 250\u2013450 cases per 1000 population and a prevalence of  P. falciparum\/P. vivax  malaria of 10\u201335%. \t Areas of  low transmission  have an annual parasite incidence of 100\u2013250 cases per 1000 population and a prevalence of  P. falciparum\/P. vivax  of 1\u201310%. It should be noted that the incidence of cases or infections is a more useful measure in geographical units in which the prevalence is low, given the difficulty of measuring prevalence accurately at low levels    (15)   . \t   Very low transmission  areas have an annual parasite incidence of &lt; 100 cases per 1000 population and a prevalence of  P. falciparum\/P. vivax  malaria &gt; 0 but &lt; 1%.    The relation between parasite incidence, parasite prevalence and the number of cases presenting to a health facility per week can be estimated in models    (16)   . For case investigation and focus investigation, local programmes must know the number of cases per health facility per week, as these activities are possible only if health workers see few cases and have sufficient time to conduct investigations within a reasonable workload. Generally, only in areas with \u201cvery low transmission\u201d is the number of cases small enough (perhaps fewer than two or three cases per week per health facility) to permit investigation and follow-up. Training and preparation for this work must precede this stage.  Differences in transmission from one area to another may be due to geographical characteristics, such as altitude, temperature and humidity, rainfall patterns, proximity to water bodies, land use, vector distribution, socio-demographic characteristics, access to anti-malarial treatment and implementation of vector control. In most endemic areas, seasonal patterns of transmission are seen, with high transmission during part of the year. Both the intensity and timing of transmission are important considerations in designing elimination strategies. \u00a0\u00b2\u00a0\u201cIncidence\u201d is the number of new events or cases of disease that develop in a population of individuals at risk during a specified interval    (14)   ; here, it is the annual number of new malaria cases per 1000 population at risk. \u00b3 This rate typically applies only to  P. falciparum , as such high levels are not usually achieved in  P. vivax  infections."},{"nid":246,"text_data":"1.2.1 Component A: Enhancing and optimizing vector control and case management  Vector control strategies, such as use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs\/LLINs\u2074) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), together with case management (prompt access to diagnosis and effective treatment) are critical for reducing malaria morbidity and mortality, and reducing malaria transmission. In all areas, especially as programmes approach elimination, it is essential to \u201c Ensure universal access to malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment \u201d for at-risk populations (GTS pillar 1).  In many countries, continued access to core malaria prevention will be required even as transmission is markedly reduced: a large proportion of the reduction in receptivity is due to vector control. Once elimination has been achieved, vector control may be \u201cfocalized\u201d rather than scaled back, i.e. the intervention should be made available for defined at-risk populations to prevent reintroduction or resumption of local transmission. \u00a0\u2074\u00a0Since 2007, the ITNs distributed have been LLINs; however, the number of ITNs is still used as an indicator of\u00a0standard coverage and use.

This is essential for tracking cases and responding to data received.  In this programme step, activities should be started early, even in settings where the intensity of transmission is high or moderate, so that systems are in place for characterizing, classifying and investigating each malaria case and focus as transmission intensity is reduced. For example, early steps to strengthen the surveillance system so that it becomes an actual intervention against malaria include:    testing all individuals with suspected malaria and recording all confirmed cases; \t enhancing the quality and timeliness of case reporting through training, supervising and retraining (in case of staff turnover); \t including community case detection, confirmation and reporting of malaria cases; \t including cases detected by all parts of the health system (e.g. public, private, nongovernmental organizations, military); and \t developing reference laboratory capacity for verification of parasitological diagnosis of malaria, which is required for decision-making.      FIG. 3.     Illustrative intervention package    \u00a0       As transmission is reduced and the number of cases decreases, the information obtained should be more and more detailed and dynamic. Surveillance not only provides information to determine which interventions are required but is also a pivotal component for complete interruption of transmission (see    section 2   ). This includes the response triggered by case and focus investigation:    building systems for reactive case investigation; \t collecting relevant information on travel to determine or estimate whether malaria infections are local or imported; and \t documenting elimination through continuous surveillance and reporting and ensuring that reintroduction does not occur (see below).    All countries that have eliminated malaria have established strong information systems and maintained them to prevent or contain re-establishment of the disease. \u00a0"},{"nid":248,"text_data":"1.2.3 Component C: Accelerating transmission reduction  As part of the GTS pillar \u201c Accelerate efforts towards elimination and attainment of malaria-free status \u201d, component C refers to the speed at which universal coverage with core malaria interventions is achieved for at-risk populations and at which surveillance systems generate detailed, dynamic information. Depending on the local context, component C may also include deployment of additional, timely, efficient interventions to reduce transmission intensity to sufficiently low levels that the few remaining infections can be found, treated and cleared as soon as they arise.  Possible means of acceleration include strategies such as population-wide parasite clearance by mass drug administration, which is currently recommended for consideration in areas approaching elimination    (9)   , and potential strategies such as additional vector control and vaccines, if and when they become available. Decisions to use such means of acceleration are made for each location after careful assessment of factors such as transmission intensity and system readiness (see    section-2.7    for more information)."},{"nid":249,"text_data":"1.2.4 Component D: Investigating and clearing individual cases, managing foci and following up  Component D is the other part of the GTS pillar \u201c Accelerate efforts towards elimination and attainment of malaria-free status \u201d, which can be implemented effectively once a programme has attained a very low intensity of malaria transmission through acceleration strategies. The programme must be capable of finding the few remaining infections and any foci of ongoing transmission and investigating and clearing them with appropriate treatment and possibly additional vector control (see    section 2   ).  Documentation of zero infections and no local transmission is critical to verify (in local health facility catchment areas or at district level) and ultimately certify (at national level) that elimination has been achieved. Once elimination has been achieved, surveillance (identifying cases or foci and responding to them) becomes the mainstay of future health system work to maintain elimination. This is the case in every country in which malaria has been eliminated: these countries continue to maintain surveillance and information systems and the ability to detect any introduced or imported cases and ensure no local transmission.  Box 3  describes the case-based method for documenting elimination of malaria.  When a programme achieves and maintains zero cases of malaria, high quality and coverage of the intervention package of components A, B and D must be maintained.    BOX 3.\u00a0     Documenting malaria elimination    (17)        Determination of elimination relies principally on a high-quality, comprehensive system for case-based surveillance and outreach, with systematic documentation of the absence of indigenous malaria over time, such as the three years before verification or certification of malaria elimination. The case-based measures are the following.    All cases of suspected malaria are tested with quality-assured methods (RDTs* or microscopy). \t All tested cases are negative or are positive\u2075\u00a0with probable exposure to malaria outside the area. \t All test-positive imported cases are followed and shown not to lead to indigenous transmission.    * The diagnostic performance of currently available RDTs is adequate for the detection of low-density parasitaemia (in the range of 100\u2013200 parasites\/\u00b5L) caused by  P. falciparum\u2076 \u00a0and  P. vivax  and evaluated by the WHO Product Testing Programme    (18)   . However, RDTs are not evaluated for detection of  P. malariae  and  P. ovale  because of lack of sources of suitable mono-species infections with these parasites. Published data suggest that the sensitivity of RDTs for detecting these species is significantly poorer than that for  P. falciparum  and  P. vivax . Therefore, negative findings of RDTs targeting all non-falciparum infections should be supported by use of more sensitive and specific techniques (i.e. expert microscopy).  As a country creates malaria transmission-free areas, documentation may initially be necessary only for the communities in the catchment areas of one or a group of health facilities. As elimination is extended, the groupings may include full districts, groups of districts, provinces and regions. Such measurement and documentation capacity is necessary for subnational verification and for ultimate certification. \u00a0 \u2075\u00a0If combination Pf\/pan RDTs are used, tests with a positive pan-line and a negative Pf-line require\u00a0confirmatory testing for species identification by expert microscopy or polymerase chain reaction.  \u2076\u00a0This refers to P. falciparum parasites that express HRP2 antigen."},{"nid":251,"text_data":"2.1 Strategies and interventions for malaria elimination  This and subsequent sections describe the work required as countries approach malaria elimination, moving from low to no local transmission. Key strategies and interventions for malaria elimination are summarized in  Box 4.  Before elimination is attempted, a core set of interventions should already be in place, including optimal coverage of vector control, high-quality, timely case management, and an ever-improving information and surveillance system capable of confirming and characterizing cases, and measuring intervention coverage and transmission dynamics.    BOX 4.\u00a0     Strategies and interventions for malaria elimination: key points       Most countries have diverse transmission intensity, and factors such as ecology, immunity, vector behaviour, social factors and health system characteristics influence both the diversity of transmission and the effectiveness of tools, intervention packages and strategies in each locality. \t To manage the inherent complexity of addressing transmission intensities in different geographical areas, malaria programmes should stratify their national maps of malaria distribution into discrete areas. \t Stratification should, if possible:\t   differentiate receptive from non-receptive areas; \t\t identify receptive areas in which malaria transmission has already been curtailed by current interventions; \t\t distinguish between areas with widespread transmission and those in which transmission occurs only in discrete foci; \t\t differentiate strata by transmission intensity, particularly if different intensities are being addressed by different sets of interventions; and \t\t determine geographical variations and population characteristics that are associated with vulnerability. \t   \t Stratification allows better targeting and efficiency, with assignment of specific packages of interventions and deployment strategies to designated strata. \t Stratification packages may include:\t   further enhancement and optimization of vector control; \t\t further strengthening of timely detection, high-quality diagnosis (confirmation) and management and tracking of cases; \t\t strategies to accelerate clearance of parasites or vectors in order to reduce transmission rapidly when possible; and \t\t information, detection and response systems to identify, investigate and clear remaining malaria foci. \t   \t Optimal coverage of ITNs\/LLINs or IRS should be ensured and maintained in strata that are both receptive and vulnerable to malaria transmission. \t Vector control interventions should be conducted in addition to ITNs\/LLINs and\/or IRS according to the principles of integrated vector management and evidence-based, WHO-recommended strategies.    National malaria programmes have tools (e.g. insecticides to kill vectors, methods to prevent vector\u2013human contact, diagnostics to detect infections and document clearance of infections, a variety of medicines to kill parasites in humans) and strategies to use those tools (e.g. spraying insecticides on walls or distributing ITNs\/ LLINs, managing clinical illness or proactively seeking infected people or at-risk populations to ensure clearance or prophylaxis of malaria infections). As described in    section 6   , new tools and strategies will become available in the future; nevertheless, even current tools and strategies can dramatically reduce the malaria disease burden and transmission; many countries have already eliminated malaria with existing tools. In order to define optimal intervention packages, current and evolving transmission intensities and the ecological and epidemiological features of the areas of a country must be understood."},{"nid":252,"text_data":"2.2 Local stratification by malaria transmission intensity  As elimination activities are expected to change the epidemiology of malaria rapidly and profoundly, the stratification of national malaria maps should be revised frequently, for example at the end of each transmission season or at an appropriate month of each year.  Geographical units are categorized on the basis of their receptivity (defined as the ability of an ecosystem to allow transmission of malaria) and the intensity of transmission (as described in    section 1   ). Stratification should initially be done at the lowest geographical level for which operational decisions can be made, such as a district, sub-district, village or health facility catchment area. Stratification begins with categorization of each selected geographical unit into a stratum, according to the sequence shown in  Fig. 4.      FIG. 4.     Sequential stratification according to receptivity and transmission intensity of a diffuse or focal geographical area targeted for malaria elimination         The first categorization differentiates receptive from non-receptive areas; the second distinguishes receptive areas without malaria transmission as a result of interventions; the third identifies receptive areas with widespread transmission and areas with transmission only in discrete foci; and the fourth stratifies areas with persistent transmission by transmission intensity to guide targeting of interventions.  Areas with no vectors are not receptive to malaria and should be categorized as such. In practice, in some settings, non-receptive areas are identified as those that have had no vector control and no locally transmitted malaria cases but have had high-quality surveillance for several years. In some countries, certain areas can be categorized as non-receptive on the basis of their landscape. If the smallest geographical unit of stratification comprises both receptive and non-receptive areas, it must be classified as receptive. While vector control is not required in non-receptive areas, cases may still be imported; therefore effective case management will always be required.  At sites in which there is some malaria receptivity but no current transmission, continued measures may be required to prevent re-establishment of transmission. The extent of such measures should be commensurate with the risk for reintroduction of malaria from elsewhere; this risk is known as the \u201cvulnerability\u201d of an area. Vulnerability can be measured directly as the incidence of imported cases in an area or estimated indirectly as the population flow from endemic areas. Receptivity and vulnerability are discussed further in    section 4.       The progression from low transmission to elimination passes through a phase in which fewer, more discrete malaria foci are identified, investigated and cleared. In \u201clow transmission\u201d areas, transmission may still be too high for observation of discrete foci; in this case, an appropriate package of interventions should be used, comprising either better quality and coverage or the addition of new interventions, to further reduce transmission. In settings with \u201cvery low\u201d transmission, cases will increasingly be clustered, and the surveillance system must be sufficiently sensitive to identify such clustering in health facility catchment areas or individual villages, to characterize it fully and to clear the infections and remaining transmission. The surveillance programme must be strengthened well in advance so that the staff and systems are fully prepared to undertake this work, which is required for the achievement and documentation of elimination."},{"nid":255,"text_data":"2.3.1.1 ITNs\/LLINs  High coverage of ITN\/LLIN can be achieved and maintained most rapidly by a combination of mass free-distribution campaigns and continuous distribution channels    (19)   . Distribution campaigns with a target of one net for every two people or one net for every sleeping space can rapidly achieve high coverage. As many households have an odd number of occupants, an overall ratio of 1 ITN\/LLIN for every 1.8 people in the targeted population should be used to calculate overall ITN\/LLIN procurement    (20)   . The frequency of mass campaigns should be decided on the basis of net durability, and only WHO-recommended ITNs\/LLINs should be procured and distributed.

A significant advantage of IRS for the containment of malaria foci is that it does not require human behavioural change, except when people refuse access to their houses or re-plaster their walls soon after spraying; such problems can sometimes be solved by using a more acceptable insecticide. Unlike ITNs\/LLINs, which remain effective during several transmission seasons, IRS may be effective for only two to six months, depending on the insecticide formulation and spray surface.  Failure to achieve high coverage and high-quality implementation of either ITNs\/LLINs or IRS should not be compensated by adding the other intervention    (5)   . Continued use of ITNs\/LLINs is recommended even in areas where vectors are moderately resistant to the ITN\/LLIN insecticide. In areas with vectors resistant to pyrethroids, where ITNs\/LLINs are the primary intervention, IRS with application in rotation of different classes of insecticide should be used to manage resistance    (21) ."},{"nid":258,"text_data":"2.3.2.1 Larval source management  Larval source management consists of the management of water bodies that are potential sites for anopheline oviposition    (23)    in order to reduce the production of adult vectors, either temporarily or permanently. This intervention is recommended in areas where larval habitats are \u201cfew, fixed and findable\u201d    (24)   , i.e. close to houses; such conditions are likely to exist when transmission has become increasingly focal. Effective larval source management requires understanding of the ecology of larval habitat productivity and effective monitoring of both the larval and adult stages of the vector in order to determine the effectiveness of the intervention. Larval source management can be categorized as habitat modification, habitat manipulation, biological control or chemical larviciding (including the use of insect growth regulators). Use of the last three categories can temporarily reduce vectorial capacity and contribute to malaria elimination in some settings; however, permanent removal of larval habitats (habitat modification) will reduce potential re-establishment of transmission once malaria has been eliminated, by permanently reducing the density of the vector population and proportionally reducing vectorial capacity. Reintroduction of malaria parasites into an area with effective habitat modification will be less likely to result in local malaria transmission."},{"nid":259,"text_data":"2.3.2.2 Additional strategies  Additional strategies may be required to reduce the disease burden caused by vectors that feed outdoors or early in the day or are resistant to insecticides.

Such foci may be due to particularly intense vectorial capacity, lapsed prevention and treatment services, changes in vectors or parasites that make the current strategies less effective, or reintroduction of malaria parasites by the movement of infected people or, more rarely, infected mosquitoes.  The vector species should be identified and their susceptibility to currently used insecticides evaluated. Supplementary vector control may be justified in some settings,such as for vectors that are not vulnerable to ITNs\/LLINs or IRS due to physiological or behavioural resistance. Supplementary vector control should be based on WHO-recommended strategies and with products approved by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme."},{"nid":261,"text_data":"2.3.4 Vector control activities after elimination or prevention of re-establishment  Soon after elimination has been achieved, vector control coverage should be maintained in receptive areas where there is a substantial risk for reintroduction (vulnerable areas). An assessment in 2015 by the WHO Vector Control Technical Expert Group indicated that discontinuing vector control increases the risk for malaria resurgence, even in areas with substantially reduced transmission, and the risk increases with increasing receptivity and importation rates and low coverage of active disease surveillance and case management. WHO therefore recommends the following.    In areas with recent local malaria transmission (residual non-active foci), a reduction in vector control is not recommended. Optimal coverage with effective malaria vector control (including the use of new tools when they become available) of all people in such areas should be pursued and maintained. \t In areas where transmission has been interrupted for more than three years (cleared foci), any reduction in vector control should be based on a detailed analysis, including assessment of the receptivity and vulnerability of the area and the capacity for active disease surveillance and response. \t Countries and partners should continue to invest in health systems, including continuous support for malaria surveillance; when receptivity is reduced, a reduction in vector control may be considered in some geographical areas.    Vector control programmes should assess the receptivity of a geographical area from data predating increased use of ITNs\/LLINs and IRS and should also consider the dynamic nature of receptivity. Changing land use patterns (including urbanization), climate, housing quality and use of strategies that permanently reduce vectorial capacity (e.g. environmental modification) may dramatically reduce malaria receptivity. Changes that increase receptivity may be less common but might include the introduction of agricultural, mining or forestry activities that multiply vector breeding sites."},{"nid":262,"text_data":"2.3.5 Monitoring and evaluating vector control  Monitoring the coverage, quality and impact of vector control interventions is essential to maintain the effectiveness of control (see illustrative list of indicators in    Annex 3   ). Each programme should identify and use relevant indicators according to their priorities, especially process indicators, in accordance with strategic and operational plans. Any indicator measured should generate data that can be used for response. Monitoring and evaluation of vector control should include all ecological and epidemiological scenarios, including areas from which malaria has been eliminated but which remain at risk for re-establishment of transmission.  The numbers of ITNs\/LLINs distributed and of houses sprayed and vector breeding sites should be determined by geo-positioning and mapping in order to evaluate intervention coverage and its effect. Interventions directed at either the adult or the larval stage should be evaluated by monitoring relevant changes in vector characteristics, such as susceptibility to the insecticide, vector density and the behaviour of the adult vector population. Malaria vector control programmes should quickly detect and respond to such changes if necessary.    The effectiveness of anti-larval campaigns should be evaluated by their impact on adult mosquito populations; larval surveys alone are not sufficient    (23)   . \t The effectiveness of ITNs\/LLINs and IRS depends on the timing and location of blood meals. Strategies for sampling adult vectors are not effective for all vector species and do not work equally well indoors and outdoors, with the exception of human landing catches.\u2077\u00a0Paired (indoor and outdoor) all-night landing catches at the times of peak vector population enable simultaneous determination of the relative frequency of outdoor- and indoor-biting and the time of biting. The samples collected can be used to determine the vector species present, to estimate survivorship and to determine susceptibility to insecticides. \t Residual malaria transmission can occur even with good access to and use of ITNs\/LLINs or well-implemented IRS as well as in situations where ITN\/LLIN use or IRS are not practical. Good understanding of the behaviour of local vector species (feeding, resting and breeding preferences) and of the human population (sociocultural factors such as mobility, extent of uptake of preventive measures by vulnerable populations such as forest workers, and difficulty in achieving optimal adherence to anti-malarial treatment) should be the basis of a plan to control malaria in such areas of residual transmission.    \u2077 Human landing catches do not increase the risk of the collectors for malaria over that of the general adult population when collection is undertaken by recommended practices; e.g. collectors are provided with prophylaxis and are recruited from the local adult population.

If the population has good access to health care workers, PCD can result in early identification and treatment of cases and reduce the risk for ongoing transmission.  Effective PCD services have become much more common and less costly since RDTs and electronic data recording and transmission became available. The services can be provided by health workers or volunteers in health facilities or in the community and are a priority for all malaria programmes. PCD in areas in which elimination is being undertaken should cover the entire population, including people living in remote areas, to increase the probability that any case of illness that might be malaria will be rapidly tested, treated and reported. Programmes should identify, by mapping or another means, any communities in receptive areas that are far from public health facilities and add additional health posts or community health workers to those locations to extend the reach of the PCD network. Imported malaria cases can occur in non-receptive areas and should also be correctly managed.  Confirmed cases should receive the full recommended treatment (including radical treatment for  P.   vivax  to clear persistent liver-stage parasites and singledose primaquine for  P. falciparum  to clear gametocytes) and be followed up at recommended intervals to ensure complete cure.

ACD can play an important role in elimination programmes by detecting infected people who may risk transmitting malaria but are not detected by PCD. As in PCD, all patients with confirmed malaria should receive the full recommended treatment, be followed up to ensure that the infection is cleared and be reported to health information systems.  If ACD is conducted because of limited or under-utilization of health care services, it may comprise initial screening for symptoms, followed by appropriate laboratory confirmation. In low-transmission settings or as part of a focus investigation, ACD may consist of testing of a defined population group without prior symptom screening (population-wide or mass testing) in order to identify asymptomatic infections.  ACD has limited benefit for  P. vivax  malaria, because liver-stage hypnozoites cannot be detected with current testing methods. In subtropical areas (and, more markedly in the past, in temperate climates), vivax malaria often has a seasonal pattern. Intensified case detection could be a rational choice for ensuring detection of relapses and delayed primary attacks during those seasons."},{"nid":267,"text_data":"2.4.1.3 Reactive case detection  ACD may also be conducted in a targeted, reactive fashion after identification (by either PCD or ACD) of a local or imported case.

RCD is an important component of an elimination strategy at low transmission intensity and is related to the concept of focus investigations. The type of RCD is determined by how the case is identified, how wide the net is cast around the index case and who is tested; the strategy chosen for a given area depends on local epidemiology and the health system.

It requires well-trained staff and laboratory support.    Therefore, RDTs should be available at all levels in health facilities and community services, while quality-assured microscopy should be available in hospitals and designated laboratories. RDTs should be available even at health facilities with good laboratories, because they allow rapid diagnosis when laboratory personnel are absent. RDTs and microscopy can be used to detect almost all symptomatic infections and many but not all asymptomatic infections.\u2079\u00a0  More sensitive diagnostic methods, such as polymerase chain reaction and other molecular techniques, are used to detect asymptomatic infections with very low parasite densities. These tests may be useful in surveys for mapping submicroscopic infections, but their value depends on the epidemiological significance of low-density infections, which is not yet sufficiently defined. Currently, most molecular methods can be performed only in laboratories with sophisticated equipment and skilled personnel; they are not recommended for routine case management or surveillance.  Both RDTs and microscopy must be supported by a quality assurance programme.

Their engagement requires that the public sector invest in communication, training, monitoring and, in many cases, provision of quality-assured diagnostics and medicines.

The informal private sector, however, may be a major source of irrational treatment, substandard medicines and under- or no reporting of malaria cases.

In some countries, community workers receive regular remuneration. Because community services are often the best solution for people living in remote areas, countries should consider how to ensure high-quality community outreach that includes testing and treatment for malaria.  The quality of care relies on appropriate diagnosis, treatment and counselling of patients and carers, applied with clear protocols and monitoring systems. The administration of medicines under supervised treatment (sometimes referred to as directly observed treatment, or DOT) may improve patient adherence to treatment and allows close patient monitoring during treatment.

In general, in areas of high transmission, people usually experience repeated infections from early in life and develop a significant degree of immunity with increasing age and exposure. That is why, in such areas, the risk of clinical malaria and death tends to be concentrated in younger children. Acquired immunity tends to limit parasite replication but rarely leads to sterilizing immunity. As such, in areas with significant levels of acquired immunity, a high proportion of the population can harbour parasites in the absence of significant clinical manifestations. This same epidemiologic picture applies to areas that have only recently reduced transmission as acquired immunity to malaria can last for many years.  In contrast, in areas of very low transmission where the risk of infection throughout life is low, few people develop any significant level of immunity. Those infected, even at very low parasite densities, will exhibit clinical signs and symptoms. Therefore, the proportion of the population infected in the absence of clinical manifestations would tend to be very low.  While all malaria elimination programmes must provide timely diagnosis and treatment for all malaria cases, they should consider the local transmission dynamics and determine whether, when and where to seek and treat asymptomatic individuals, who do not present to health facilities for care. Such an approach should be considered only in the context of persistent transmission in spite of intensified vector control and efficient surveillance systems.  If local malaria transmission persists despite intensive vector control and universally good case management, the programme may consider undertaking special studies to evaluate the distribution and frequency of infections in the asymptomatic population.  If the programme decides that all symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in an active focus must be cleared, the work must be well planned and all efforts made to reach the entire targeted population, including ill and apparently healthy people, young and old. Special consideration should be given to the treatment of specific populations (e.g. pregnant women, newborns, mobile populations).  The following points should be considered.    Currently available point-of-care tests for malaria have little capacity to detect low-density infections; thus, consideration should be given to treating the entire population, regardless of test results and regardless of symptoms. \t All people should be treated with safe, effective anti-malarial medicines that will clear all  asexual  stage parasites. \t For  P. falciparum  infections, treatment to clear sexual stage parasites (gametocytes) should also be given. Currently available artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is effective against developing stages 1\u20134 gametocytes but not the infectious stage 5 gametocytes, which require a gametocytocide (i.e. single-dose primaquine at 0.25 mg\/kg of body weight) (27),10\u00a0which can prevent the transmission to mosquitoes of sexual stage parasites present in the blood. \t For confirmed  P.   vivax  (and the much less common  P. ovale ), treatment should include both schizontocidal medicine and anti-relapse therapy to clear their dormant liverstage parasites (hypnozoites). Ideally, treatment should be administered only after G6PD testing is performed; the appropriate dose and duration of primaquine can then be selected (see    Annex 2   ). Such treatment dramatically reduces the frequency of relapses and their contribution to transmission.  \u00a0\u00b9\u2070 The recommendation includes the following: In low-transmission areas, give a single dose of 0.25 mg\/ kg of body weight primaquine with an ACT to patients with  P. falciparum  malaria (except pregnant women, infants aged &lt; 6 months and women breastfeeding infants aged &lt; 6 months) to reduce transmission.

The key activities of elimination surveillance systems are:    ensuring that an entire area (national or subnational) targeted for elimination is covered, with particular attention to areas with on-going or recent transmission; \t quality-assured diagnostic testing; \t testing of all cases of suspected malaria, reporting of all confirmed cases, investigation of all cases and foci and recording of all tests and investigations; \t case detection activities to:\t   ensure rapid, complete treatment for parasite clearance in as many cases as possible to minimize the time during which cases can infect vectors; and \t\t provide information to monitor the programme\u2019s progress; \t   \t following standard operating procedures for all components of surveillance and monitoring compliance in real time; and \t participation of all health care providers treating malaria cases in the surveillance system.

Reclassification should be based on regular review, usually at the end of the calendar year or of the transmission season.  A register of foci is maintained at district and national levels, which is updated with new data on interventions and findings as they are accrued. Focus classification is updated at the end of each calendar year or transmission season, depending on the programme policy.  Residual non-active foci should remain non-active (no indigenous cases) for three consecutive years before a programme applies for malaria elimination certification.13 \u00a0 \u00b9\u00b2\u00a0In a previous WHO document on malaria elimination  (32) , seven types of focus were identified; however, experience has shown that these posed difficulties at local level and had minimal operational implications.

Vector control measures are assessed for their appropriateness, coverage and use and increased according to the characteristics of malaria in the area, with particular attention to its receptivity. \t PCD services are accessible to all members of the population throughout the year, with supervision at defined intervals. \t For active foci, various options exist. First, high coverage of appropriate vector control should be maintained. ACD (with screening and testing or with testing alone) can be considered at appropriate intervals, especially just before or during the transmission season. If testing is chosen and no cases have been found after several rounds of ACD, the frequency of testing may be reduced or the strategy changed to passive surveillance for suspected clinical cases that can be tested and managed as necessary. In some circumstances, mass drug administration may be appropriate. \t For residual non-active foci, ACD may be considered at key times (e.g. the mid and late transmission season), and people most likely to have malaria (e.g. those with fever, migrant labourers, those not using prevention) are screened to identify local cases, indicative of ongoing transmission. If several rounds of ACD reveal no cases, the frequency may be reduced. If new introduced or indigenous cases are identified, further evaluation is required to determine whether there is indigenous transmission, which would require additional action (see  Fig. 6 ). \t For cleared foci, the programme should rely on the surveillance system to rapidly identify any cases of suspected malaria and determine whether local transmission has resumed.

In the early stages, data from malaria indicator surveys, demographic and health surveys and multiple indicator cluster surveys may provide useful information on disease burden and intervention coverage. As the prevalence of malaria decreases, such surveys play a smaller role in assessing the burden of disease and infection.  The most important surveys or special assessments in the late stages of a programme may be those on operational factors, such as coverage of key prevention interventions, the quality and availability of diagnosis and understanding of how to identify and manage a suspected case and how to investigate a confirmed case.14\u00a0Where appropriate, population-level information on intervention coverage and use can be collected during the process of case and\/or foci investigation. Health facility surveys may be used to investigate the quality of diagnosis and treatment of malaria. \u00a0 \u00b94\u00a0In some settings and in certain research projects, surveys have been conducted with highly sensitive diagnostic tests or serology in certain at-risk populations to obtain complementary information on infection clearance.

Regular data (immediate, weekly, monthly) should be available at the local level for evaluation and should be disseminated to districts or to intermediate level, the national malaria programme and the national reference laboratory. As a country sets elimination targets, a computerized geo-referenced database should be established that covers all cases, including those seen outside the public health system. This database will support programme management and can be used for in-depth analysis and response.  Repositories of all malaria reports, records of case detection, entomological monitoring of vector behaviour and intervention quality and focus investigations, special surveys, case registers and focus registers, should be maintained at district and central levels.

Once efficacy monitoring has been integrated into overall case surveillance, treatment should be given to all patients (regardless of age and parasitaemia) under direct observation. At a minimum, the patient should be assessed clinically and parasitologically daily for the first three days and weekly thereafter (until day 28 or day 42 for ACT containing a partner drug with a long half-life).

Pillar 3 of the  Global technical strategy for malaria 2016\u20132030  (GTS)   (2)    is transformation of malaria surveillance into a core intervention in all malaria-endemic countries and in those countries that have eliminated malaria but remain susceptible to re-establishment of transmission  (Fig. 1) .  Surveillance is therefore the basis of operational activities in settings of any level of transmission. Its objective is to support reduction of the burden of malaria, eliminate the disease and prevent its re-establishment. In settings in which transmission remains relatively high and the aim of national programmes is to reduce the burdens of morbidity and mortality, malaria surveillance is often integrated into broader routine health information systems to provide data for overall analysis of trends, stratification and planning of resource allocation. In settings in which malaria is being eliminated, the objectives of surveillance are to identify, investigate and eliminate foci of continuing transmission, prevent and cure infections and confirm elimination. After elimination has been achieved, its role becomes that of preventing re-establishment of malaria.  A malaria surveillance system comprises the people, procedures, tools and structures necessary to generate information on malaria cases and deaths. The information is used for planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating malaria programmes. An effective malaria surveillance system enables programme managers to:    identify and target areas and population groups most severely affected by malaria, to deliver the necessary interventions effectively and to advocate for resources;      FIG. 1.

In previous editions of WHO manuals on surveillance    (3,4)   , a country was considered to be a single transmission setting, and advice on the design of its surveillance system was based on this premise. The natural heterogeneity of malaria, however, and the variable impacts of interventions and socioeconomic and environmental changes within a country result in progress often achieved at different speeds in different parts of a country and against different parasite species. Hence, a country may decide to conduct elimination activities in one part and to focus on reducing the number of deaths and disease in another. The GTS    (2)    therefore introduced the concept of a continuum  (Fig. 2 ) , whereby progress towards malaria elimination is considered to be a continuous process rather than a set of independent stages. By extension,    FIG. 2.     Malaria heterogeneity across the transmission continuum    As transmission decreases, malaria becomes focal, and the intensity and frequency of reporting increase. Surveillance systems evolve from reporting aggregate case data by month over large geographical areas (e.g. district) to reporting near-realtime individual case data in small areas (foci).       \u00a0  countries are now advised to establish surveillance systems that are appropriate to their heterogeneous epidemiology.  As transmission decreases, the epidemiology of malaria is likely to change.    The number of uncomplicated malaria cases and related fevers will decrease. \t The numbers of severe cases and deaths will decrease, although the proportion of severe to uncomplicated disease may increase. \t Malaria transmission will become more focal. \t The age distribution of cases of disease will become more evenly distributed, reflecting decreasing exposure. \t In some settings, disease may become more prevalent among people in certain occupations, such as forest workers. \t Populations will become less immune, and the risk of epidemics and the associated case fatality ratio will increase if interventions are interrupted. \t Imported cases may represent an increasing fraction of the overall incidence. \t In countries with both  P. falciparum  and  P. vivax  malaria, the proportion of vivax will gradually increase, as the transmission of falciparum can be reduced faster with current interventions, while vivax infection includes a hypnozoite stage that will evade detection with current standard diagnostics.    The goals and possibilities of surveillance, monitoring and evaluation also evolve during this transition, as outlined throughout the manual.    In areas of high transmission, programme monitoring and evaluation are based mainly on aggregate numbers, and actions are designed to ensure that the entire population has access to services and there are no adverse disease trends. \t In areas with low or moderate transmission, the distribution of malaria is more heterogeneous, and it is important to identify the population groups that are most severely affected by the disease and to target interventions appropriately. This will be facilitated by mapping areas of ongoing transmission and analysis of case distribution at community level. \t As transmission is reduced, the risk of epidemics increases; thus, cases at health facilities must be analysed more frequently to ensure early detection of a potential outbreak.\u00a0 \t As progress is made towards elimination, it is critical to ensure efficient detection of and response to new cases and foci. Individual cases of infection or clusters of cases should be investigated to identify risk factors, eliminate foci of transmission and maintain malaria-free status. Surveillance systems become more complex and resource intensive, and additional skills, training and activities are required. As the number of cases is reduced and a country nears elimination, the frequency of case investigations will decrease, thereby eventually reducing the costs of surveillance."},{"nid":308,"text_data":"3.2.1 Monitoring and evaluation  As for control programmes, monitoring (systematic tracking of programme actions over time, including budget allocations and adherence to standard operating procedures) and evaluation (examining progress and its determinants) are essential for measuring how well an elimination programme is operating over time and whether it is achieving its milestones and goals. In the context of \u201cscale-up for impact\u201d, monitoring and evaluation consist of evaluating the reduction in burden. As transmission is reduced, however, monitoring and evaluation with strong surveillance systems (see    section 2.6.6   ) should consist of detecting infections and measuring transmission dynamics    (12)   . A detailed monitoring and evaluation plan should include a manageable set of the most important indicators, determined according to programme goals and interventions used. While the coverage indicators used in control programmes remain useful, some will have to be adapted and new indicators introduced. Some recommended indicators for elimination programmes are listed in     Annex 3   .

This is especially important in elimination programmes, as reported data must be analysed rapidly to assess trends over time and place, particularly as transmission decreases and the distribution of cases of infection becomes increasingly focal. \t completeness: Are data missing?    Data quality can be maximized by ensuring strong, well-functioning information systems that facilitate the collection and reporting of the required information by programme staff.

A highquality data management system facilitates entry of indicators by field workers, improves quality by allowing data checks and validation, ensures rapid, faithful transmission to central levels, allows cross-referencing and analysis of metrics from various programme components and ensures feedback to all levels of the data collection system to encourage participation and improve performance. As mentioned in    section 2.6.6 ,  elimination programmes are advised to establish a computerized, geo-referenced database that includes all cases.  The collection of data directly in electronic form, such as on mobile phones, tablets or computers, tends to be more rapid and results in fewer errors than use of paper forms, questionnaires or registries. Not all electronic systems are user-friendly, however, and if electronic devices break, run out of power or are stolen, monitoring may break down. The local context must be carefully considered in designing any system, and no one system is suitable everywhere.  Data entered into the system should be checked regularly, including for:    completeness: Have all the required fields been filled, and have all staff and facilities reported? \t consistency: Are contradictory results reported in different fields (e.g. a patient is reported to have no travel history but the case is classified as imported), which call the metric into question? \t plausibility: Are the values (e.g. patient age) within the expected range? \t duplication: Has each report been entered only once, and are reports referring to the same individual or household properly linked?

Between formal courses, routine supportive supervision and targeted feedback can be effective for honing staff skills and empowering them to trust the tools and systems they are using.  To ensure that experienced staff who are of great value to the programme are retained, they should be paid sufficiently attractive salaries for their jobs, to motivate them to continue.

For case management, all points of care must have proper stocks of diagnostic and treatment commodities; for ACD surveys, commodities must be accurately quantified to ensure sufficient coverage of at-risk populations. In all cases, stocks must be adequate to adjust for changing dynamics of transmission and intervention coverage.  As the prevalence of malaria decreases, transmission becomes unstable, and countries are at increasing risk for epidemics. Epidemic preparedness plans are therefore necessary, with stockpiles of malaria commodities (diagnostic tests, anti-malarial medicines and insecticides and equipment for IRS) for epidemic response.  Even countries in which malaria transmission is very low must maintain a minimal stock of products at each level of the health care system, so that, if a case presents for care, it can be appropriately treated. In a successful elimination programme, some stock may never be used; however, expiration of unused medicines is the price to pay for ensuring that the health system is prepared for an unexpected outbreak of malaria."},{"nid":316,"text_data":"3.5 Independent national malaria elimination advisory committee  It is recommended that an advisory committee be established to provide an external view of progress and gaps in a malaria elimination programme.

Generic terms of reference for an independent national malaria elimination advisory committee are provided in    Annex 10."},{"nid":317,"text_data":"1.5 Principles of the design and establishment of malaria surveillance  The core principles of the design and establishment of malaria surveillance systems are listed below.    Accurate parasitological diagnosis of a malaria case is the foundation of a malaria surveillance system. Diagnoses should be made with either quality-assured malaria microscopy or WHO-recommended rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) (see  Box 1 ). \t All major components of a malaria surveillance system should be integrated into broader health management information systems (HMIS), including, where applicable, systems for reporting notifiable diseases. In some settings, a vertical system may be used initially, but it should allow communication with and eventually be integrated into the HMIS for sustainability. The HMIS system should, in turn, be responsive to the promptness and granularity of data required for effective malaria surveillance. \t National SOPs for surveillance should be based on a country\u2019s needs and on WHO recommendations. For elimination, regulations should be enacted through appropriate national mechanisms, so that, by law, malaria becomes a notifiable disease in all relevant sectors of the health system. In settings of burden reduction, all health sectors must also report data to the national HMIS. \t Regardless of the malaria burden, front-line staff involved in the detection, recording and reporting of cases should also be the first users of data. Thus, staff at all levels should be trained in examining and evaluating data from surveillance of both disease and operations, monitor programme progress, target interventions and detect problems that require action. Analytical capacity should therefore be available at all levels. \t Surveillance systems should address the heterogeneity of malaria within a country\u2019s boundaries. For example, monthly aggregate case 8 reporting may be sufficient in areas with a relatively high malaria burden, but, as the caseload diminishes, aggregated data should be reported weekly; then, individual cases should be reported weekly, and, once a decision has been taken for elimination, cases should be reported immediately. In elimination settings, cases should be linked to the village (or focus) and household of origin, where further case detection, treatment, classification, investigation, management and clearance of foci of transmission can be undertaken as appropriate. \t Necessary investments in surveillance and system transition, including in human resources, should be made to respond to the anticipated reduction in disease burden. For instance, surveillance systems that allow for immediate case notification, investigation and response should be in place before a country embarks on elimination. \t All surveillance data must be linked to a decision at some level of the health system, even if the decision results in no immediate change in interventions. Where appropriate, surveillance data should be combined with other data from the programme and the population to improve decision-making. In settings with a high or moderate burden of malaria, important markers of progress are trends in childhood deaths from all causes and malaria, the proportions of  P. vivax  and  P. falciparum  malaria where the latter was dominant before the intervention, and changes in the age distribution of the disease. In elimination settings, surveillance is linked to specific responses that should allow the detection of all cases of malaria infection by microscopy or WHO-recommended RDT (including symptomatic and asymptomatic infections) as early as possible; the prevention of onward transmission from each case through prompt, radical treatment and vector control; and the identification, investigation and management of all transmission foci, with appropriate measures for interrupting transmission as soon as possible. \t In all transmission settings, a concerted effort must be made to include cases detected in other sectors (e.g. in private and other nongovernmental health care facilities), as well as those detected in public health facilities. In elimination settings, it is critical that cases detected in all sectors are reported and investigated. Information is disseminated to stakeholders through different mechanisms, such as open-access surveillance bulletins, in all settings. \t After interruption of transmission, surveillance for malaria may become the broad\u00a0 responsibility of general health services. Nevertheless, the surveillance system should be supported by regular training and monitoring in a national programme to ensure identification of changes in the receptivity (i.e. suitability of the ecosystem for transmission of malaria) and vulnerability of the population (i.e. the frequency of influx of infected individuals or groups and\/or infective anopheline mosquitoes). Compulsory, immediate notification, diagnosis with quality-assured RDTs and microscopy must be maintained. \t Like most other health interventions, surveillance is likely to benefit from innovation and advances in technology. The choice of new technology should be based on proven additional benefits and the cost and sustainability, determined from empirical evidence. \t Good understanding of the biology and behavioural ecology of vector species is essential for making programme decisions and monitoring and evaluating vector control interventions, including quality assurance. The efficacy of the antimalarial drugs used for treatment of parasite infection should also be monitored regularly. Data from entomological and drug efficacy surveillance should be interpreted in conjunction with epidemiological data as a basis for programme decisions (see    section 5   ). \t Surveillance systems should be assessed routinely to ensure their accuracy, reliability, completeness, precision, timeliness and integrity. The assessment should also include the appropriateness of actions taken as a consequence of the results of surveillance.      BOX 1.     Advantages of focusing on confirmed cases of malaria    A considerable proportion of cases of fever are not due to malaria, even in high-malaria transmission settings    (6) .  In the past, however, most countries endemic for malaria based diagnosis of the disease on fever only. With increasing access to RDTs for malaria, it is now easier to quickly test patients with fever for malaria and to treat them with effective drugs if they are positive for malaria infection. This not only ensures accurate management of fever patients and reduces wastage of antimalarial drugs but also increases the quality of surveillance data. The graph below is a simple illustration of the relation between suspected malaria and confirmed infection. The graph suggests that in higher transmission settings a large number of febrile patients may be suspected of having malaria, the system may not have the capacity to diagnose all of them, and, among those who are tested, only a moderate proportion may have malaria. As transmission decreases, fewer patients are suspected of having malaria, but the systems are capable of confirming all cases, and very few have malaria. When cases are detected actively, however, everyone in an area may be tested for malaria, with or without a suspicion that they are infected. In such situations, caution is required in quantifying test positivity rates for suspected cases."},{"nid":319,"text_data":"3.6.1 Political commitment  Leaders at the highest levels must make elimination a priority, especially as the malaria burden falls and other public health issues compete for resources and commitment. High-level political involvement is necessary to secure domestic funding, to ensure flexibility in programme decision-making and to demonstrate that the government is willing to do what it takes to ensure elimination and maintain it once it has been achieved. For subnational elimination, engagement with local political leaders is important. Verified malaria elimination should be of considerable interest for a provincial governor or a state prime minister in view of the benefits for the population and the health services, in addition to economic and political aspects."},{"nid":320,"text_data":"3.6.2 Enact the necessary legislation and regulations  New legislation may be required to support elimination programmes in some contexts and programme requirements. For example, programmes should ensure compulsory notification of all confirmed cases of infection detected in both public and private health care facilities. Additionally, strengthened regulatory systems may be required for careful approval of products and tools and their use in the country; regulations can increase the availability and clarity of information and indicate the training that will be required for delivering the interventions (see also    section 6.3   )."},{"nid":322,"text_data":"3.6.3.1 Collaboration with other government sectors  Government partners that may be relevant for malaria elimination include the various departments of the ministry of health, including the national laboratory and central medical stores, and other ministries, such as those for education, the environment, public works, statistics, finance, agriculture and defence. Further considerations on collaborative responsibilities are discussed in a comprehensive review of disease eradication    (38)   ."},{"nid":323,"text_data":"3.6.3.2 Collaboration with the private sector  Many entities in the private sector have roles to play in the various facets of elimination. The agricultural sector and extractive industries may rely on migrant labourers, who are sometimes at high risk for infection with malaria parasites, and agriculture, construction and mining may create breeding sites for certain mosquito vectors. Partnership with these sectors will help ensure a healthy, productive workforce. In some countries, the tourism industry has a strong incentive to invest in anti-malarial activities.  Private health facilities like hospitals and private clinics provide much of malaria treatment in many countries. If patients who receive malaria treatment in such locations are not reported in surveillance systems, the programme may miss areas of active or potential transmission. Finding ways to enforce notification and reporting from the private health care sector will ensure good case management of those who are treated and ensure complete coverage of surveillance."},{"nid":325,"text_data":"3.6.4 Community engagement  Engaging the communities targeted for interventions is important for malaria elimination. The required level of coverage, particularly as malaria prevalence is reduced to very low levels, can be achieved and sustained only if communities are fully supportive. If communities feel that they \u201cown\u201d programmes and are actively involved in their implementation, activities will be easier to implement, and coverage targets will be more likely to be reached.  Community members should play meaningful, active roles in project development and decision-making. The objectives of community participation should include:    encouraging appropriate health-seeking behaviour; \t strengthening community access to malaria testing, treatment and reporting; \t promoting acceptance and appropriate use of vector control tools; \t empowering communities to strengthen self-monitoring and decision-making about malaria; \t building community and local political support for eliminating malaria; and \t increasing active community participation in elimination activities, including a surveillance system linked to district and other systems up to national level.

Effective coverage depends not only on access to the intervention but also on provider compliance, patient adherence and individual benefit    (39)   . Thus, a highly effective intervention (as determined in controlled trials) can result in low overall programme effectiveness because of suboptimal access to the intervention, inadequate programme targeting due to supply shortages, incomplete provider compliance or poor patient adherence.  Fig. 7  shows an example of systematic decay of overall programme effectiveness even when the individual components appear to be of acceptable quality. For elimination programmes to succeed, health systems should be evaluated for their readiness to optimize novel programmes, systems or other interventions and for their continuing performance in all aspects    (40)   .

In settings in which the main objective is to reduce the burden of malaria disease and deaths, the surveillance system is part of the routine HMIS. In elimination settings, a specific malaria surveillance system may be in place, although important components must be integrated into the HMIS.    Fig. 4  illustrates a broad framework for malaria surveillance in different transmission settings. It is aligned with the GTS    (2)   and the  Framework for malaria elimination  (5) .      Surveillance system processes and requirements along the continuum of malaria transmission settings         In areas in which transmission remains moderate to high and the main goal of national programmes is to reduce the burden of disease, there are often so many malaria cases that each confirmed case cannot be examined individually. Instead, the analysis is based on aggregated numbers obtained from routine health information systems, and action, such as determining suitable interventions and increasing coverage, is taken at population level. The initial focus will be on ensuring good-quality data, which is based on the following.  All people with suspected malaria are examined with a diagnostic test.    Cases are correctly classified according to the test result and treated with nationally\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0recommended\u00a0 \u00a0antimalarial agents. \t The quality of both microscopy and RDTs is controlled. \t Registration and reporting from health facilities are complete and consistent. \t A system is in place for assessing the surveillance system, including auditing of data quality. \t There is a process of analysing and using the surveillance data for response and for monitoring and evaluating programmes.    These conditions must be in place before countries transition to complex elimination surveillance systems. The parasite rate and annual parasite incidence thresholds presented in the framework in  Fig. 4  should be used as broad measures of the transition of a surveillance system and are not prescriptive. The aim is to highlight the notion of a continuum of transmission within a country and the need for a surveillance system that reflects the heterogeneous epidemiology. The ability to implement surveillance depends not only on the level of transmission but also on factors such as the strength of the health system and available resources. Most countries conducting elimination activities may consider that an annual parasite incidence of 100 per 1000 population is a relatively high threshold for starting case and focus investigations and may find a lower caseload to be more practical.  As transmission is progressively reduced, it becomes increasingly possible, and necessary, to track and respond to individual cases. The thresholds of transmission are not fixed; therefore, some surveillance strategies, especially in lower-transmission settings, could be initiated earlier if the resources are available. The frequency of reporting initially increases from monthly to weekly and then to near-real time, and the resolution of data increases from aggregated cases to a line listing of patients. In elimination settings, however, it is critical that the surveillance system allow immediate notification of individual cases, followed, where appropriate, by prompt case and focus investigation and response.  In all settings, the quality of surveillance systems must be monitored continuously by:    maintaining an up-to-date list of operational health facilities and other notification sources; \t making sure that all core and support functions of the systems are in place; \t keeping track of which facilities have submitted the required reports and their timeliness; \t tracking proportion of cases and foci investigated where applicable; \t following up missing, incomplete and delayed reports; \t reviewing the data submitted and following up on incomplete or erroneous data; \t providing positive feedback to health facilities that submit timely, complete, accurate data; and \t ensuring a system for up-to-date training of surveillance staff.    Data from surveillance must be interpreted carefully to identify any weaknesses in systems. During analysis and interpretation of surveillance data, information from other sources, such as surveys, civil and vital registration systems and censuses, should be included, as appropriate."},{"nid":330,"text_data":"4.1.1 Measuring the risks  An indication of the receptivity of an area may be derived from the history of malaria, in particular:    the original endemicity, if data are available; \t the vectorial capacity before and after intensive vector control. In reality, there are very few data on vectorial capacity anywhere, in the past or recently. Data on the distribution and abundance of specific vectors and the entomological inoculation rate may give some idea of vectorial capacity. In most areas, data on malaria prevalence from cross-sectional surveys give an indication of the intensity of transmission. \t environmental changes resulting from development, which may affect the vector population; and \t the stability of or changes in health system responsiveness (e.g. to vector-borne diseases).    Although past information can help in assessing receptivity, it may no longer be relevant, so that vector surveillance is the basis for preventing re-establishment. Receptivity to malaria transmission depends on the presence of local vectors and environmental and climatic conditions favourable to malaria transmission. The major determinants of receptivity, as observed in vector surveillance, are the abundance of local vectors and their ecological requirements, their degree of anthropophily, the life expectancy of the mosquitoes and the time required for parasite development in the mosquito in the climatic conditions of the area.  An indication of the degree of vulnerability can be derived from traditional patterns of travel and population flow in the area and also from unexpected patterns that result from conflicts or a sudden influx of refugees or internally displaced people. These can be determined by epidemiological investigation of cases and foci, surveys from a department of immigration or tourism or from agencies that monitor refugees and internally displaced people. Malaria is imported by the arrival in a country or area of people infected with malaria parasites. This has become common in recent decades as a result of easier, more frequent international travel and increasing flows of immigrants and refugees. Malaria can also be imported when malaria parasites are brought into an area by mosquitoes that either fly across the border or are passively transported, usually in aircraft or ships. Information on factors that can change vulnerability, such as the number of people arriving, travel history, categories of people arriving, local destination and length of stay, can be communicated promptly by mobile phone.  The combined effect of receptivity and vulnerability, and thus the risk for reestablishment of malaria transmission in a country, depends on ecological, climatic, socio-demographic, epidemiological, entomological, health system and other factors. Assessment of the risk, of its components and of the relations among them forms the basis for strategic and practical plans to prevent malaria re-establishment in the country. A detailed analysis of risk factors throughout the country could be used as the basis for stratifying the country, and designing surveillance activities appropriate for each stratum.  Receptivity and vulnerability are poorly or not correlated. Receptivity determines the possible onward transmission of malaria in a country after elimination of the disease, whereas vulnerability determines the risk for introduction of malaria parasites into a country or area in which they are not present. Juxtaposition of the two factors, however, makes it possible to identify where there is a risk for re-establishment of transmission and to simulate scenarios. If the value of one factor is 0, the possibility of malaria re-establishment is null even when the value of the other is high.  In order to maintain the malaria-free status of an area or country, the health system and the malaria programme should retain the ability to undertake one or more of the following activities:    early detection, mandatory notification and prompt treatment of all malaria cases; \t determination of the probable causes of re-establishment of malaria transmission; \t immediate action in the event of detection of local malaria transmission; and \t determination of the risk for malaria re-establishment by regular monitoring of the receptivity and vulnerability of the area. \t Maintaining capability requires funding, adequate human resources and sustained commitment at the highest level of the ministry of health."},{"nid":332,"text_data":"4.1.2.1 Reducing and mitigating receptivity  The suitability, effectiveness and quality of vector control activities should be determined from an entomological surveillance system that operates throughout the country to monitor populations of adult  Anopheles  mosquitoes (see also    section 2   ) and changes in transmission risks. Vector larval sites should also be monitored, with estimates of the abundance of larval habitats and the density of larvae and adult mosquitoes (both indoors and outdoors), insecticide resistance and meteorological indicators such as the average daily temperature and rainfall. Entomological assessments should be a priority in vulnerable areas where the receptivity is not clear, to determine whether pre-emptive vector control is needed and, if so, the strategies to be used either pre-emptively or reactively. To reduce receptivity, vector control should be maintained and adapted to local environmental conditions and vector behaviour. It should be coordinated with other programmes, local authorities and relevant services in neighbouring countries in order to reduce transmission and protect the local population on both sides of the border. Vector control should be targeted to high-risk foci, including the last ones to be cleared before elimination.  Depending on the vector, environmental management can reduce the oviposition sites of  Anopheles  mosquitoes and reduce malaria transmission by reducing the number and availability of larval habitats or rendering them less attractive to gravid anophelines.  In malaria-free receptive areas, individual and collective methods for protecting the population should be promoted."},{"nid":333,"text_data":"2.2 People-centred surveillance  The basis of a surveillance system is the community that is being served and the health workers who attend to their health needs. The frontline health workers and volunteers who are usually responsible for patient care and data recording and transmission must feel recognized and rewarded for their efforts through regular feedback, training and overall good staff management. At all levels of the information cycle, adequate investment must be made in infrastructure and human resource capacity to run and maintain surveillance systems and enable effective use of information for decision-making.  As countries reduce their malaria burden, the intensity, resolution and frequency of surveillance will increase. Surveillance will change from aggregated to case reporting and analysis. Case and focus investigation will require specialized field teams and greater analytical capacity.  Sufficient person-time is required at district, provincial and national levels for data acquisition from health information departments; importing, merging, cleaning and analysing data; mapping; and producing surveillance bulletins and reports. Regular feedback will be required, not only to other levels of the health sector but also to communities. Ministries of health, NMPs and partners should ensure that the necessary human capacity is in place and that national SOPs support all surveillance activities.  Disease surveillance requires epidemiological, statistical and computer skills and, at district and higher levels, experience in monitoring and evaluation. It is usually advantageous to link training in malaria surveillance with other training activities in order to save costs and to make more effective use of health workers\u2019 time. When possible, training in malaria surveillance should be given at the same time as training in HMIS or malaria case management, particularly in the use of diagnostic testing. The pre-service curricula of medical, nursing and pharmacy schools should be updated to reflect the latest requirements for disease surveillance. Countries should ensure that not only the public sector but also nongovernmental organizations and the private sector participate in surveillance systems, by reporting data, feedback and joint training."},{"nid":334,"text_data":"4.1.2.2 Reducing and mitigating vulnerability  In malaria-free countries or areas, malaria awareness should be maintained in the local population by various educational programmes or campaigns.

People with malaria who are planning to stay for some time or live in area with high receptivity may be provided with preventive measures such as ITNs\/LLINs.  Migrant workers and travellers exposed to malaria may receive diagnostic testing and treatment of symptoms at health centres, ideally free of charge. Likewise, prophylaxis should be distributed for free to local people travelling to endemic places, or, at the least, they should be informed of malaria prevention measures. At points of entry, immigrants from malaria-endemic countries or areas should be given printed materials on malaria, including information about what to do in case of suspected malaria."},{"nid":335,"text_data":"4.2 Maintaining a strong health system  To manage the risk for re-establishment of malaria transmission effectively, a highperforming health system should be maintained, to:    provide free diagnosis and treatment of malaria, with quality-assured microscopy and RDTs, in public health facilities; \t ensure that all suspected and confirmed malaria cases, whether treated in the public or the private sector, are notified; \t use a standard electronic form for early, mandatory notification to the ministry of health of all confirmed malaria cases in the public and private health sectors; \t investigate all confirmed cases and foci epidemiologically and entomologically; and \t establish an effective system for early detection of and response to malaria epidemics.    Once malaria has been eliminated from a country or area, the challenges are sustaining effective case management in order to maintain zero malaria deaths and ensuring continuous political and financial commitment at all national levels. These are prerequisites for adequate allocation of funds to the malaria programme to ensure continuing activities, including diagnostic, treatment and surveillance capacity. Funding will also ensure that the supply chain is fully operational and malaria commodities are available at all times, with proper management of safety stocks of essential medicines for diseases that occur at low incidence."},{"nid":336,"text_data":"4.3 Integrating malaria activities into general health services  Once malaria elimination has been achieved, maintaining the necessary technical expertise to prevent re-establishment of transmission may be challenging. Programmes should consider integrating the malaria programme into public health programmes (see above and references in    section 3   ); in such a transition, however, it is essential that expertise and functions remain operational, even if the responsible staff no longer work solely on malaria.  If a very low prevalence of malaria persists, most of the functions of what was previously a dedicated malaria programme will probably be integrated into the broader health system. Malaria will remain a notifiable disease in health reporting systems, and special studies should be integrated into the investigation systems for other emerging and epidemic vector-borne diseases. It will be important to maintain national expertise, coordinating function and capacity to react to reported malaria cases and to maintain skills in fields such as laboratory science, epidemiology, vector biology and control and informatics.  At the peripheral level, if possible, a staff member of the ministry of health with expertise in surveillance and response should be appointed as a malaria focal point. Staff who have expertise in malaria should be kept in the health system, their positions being moved to other departments. In order to keep staff motivated, all workers should be assured that elimination will not result in them losing their job.  Once elimination has been achieved, the central functions that must be maintained are limiting the consequences of malaria importation, with early detection, quality-assured diagnosis, effective treatment, epidemiological investigation of cases and foci and coordination of responses to prevent indigenous cases. A central reference laboratory with expertise in malaria diagnostics, including blood slide reading, should be maintained."},{"nid":338,"text_data":"2.3 Recording  The annexes to this manual provide suggested registers and forms that can be adapted for use by countries. Registers should provide space for recording essential data elements, such as test results, and no unnecessary elements, as the more data there are in registers and forms, the less likely it is that the forms will be completed accurately, if at all. When possible, forms should reflect current guidance, such as that provided in standard treatment guidelines, surveillance SOPs and monitoring and evaluation manuals, with a clear justification of how the variables collected will be used.  In countries where the burden of malaria is substantial and the caseload is such that individual case investigation may not be possible, malaria surveillance systems are often part of broader communicable disease surveillance or the health information system, which should be adapted to include the basic data elements suggested in this manual.  In low-transmission settings in which malaria is relatively rare and confined to particular locations, there may be a separate malaria reporting system, which allows timely response to individual cases and can be adapted according to the recommendations in this manual. The system should communicate as much as possible with the HMIS, and the main components should preferably remain integrated into the HMIS to ensure long-term sustainability.  It is important to involve all stakeholders in discussions about revising a system, especially those involved in data collection in health care facilities, who can provide valuable information about the constraints they face and practical suggestions for improvement. An inclusive process creates a sense of ownership and encourages the adoption and use of forms. New and revised forms should be tested on a small scale (e.g. in one administrative unit for 6 months) before they are used widely. After the final adjustments have been made, the documentation on use of the forms should be updated and data collectors trained in their use. When the new forms are supplied to health facilities, the old ones should be removed or destroyed to ensure that health workers do not use previous systems because of a disruption in the stationery supply or lack of familiarity with the new forms. A regular supply of forms should be ensured to alleviate this problem. When possible, an electronic system with the required back-up should be used to minimize the cost of data recording and improve the efficiency of the system.

Programmes should have an up-to-date inventory of all the public and other health facilities that are expected to report and should follow up any delays. The coordinates of all health facilities should be known so that their location can be shown on a map.  Depending on the transmission context, aggregated data (from areas where the focus is on reducing the burden) or line-listings of patients (in very low transmission and elimination settings) are expected to be submitted routinely throughout the surveillance system. The health facility case data should be supported by information on the number of CHWs expected to report to them and the actual number who do so; this information can be written on the health facility reporting form. The data from health facilities and CHWs should be kept separate and not added to health centre attendance, to avoid affecting trends over time by fluctuations in reporting from lower-level facilities (e.g. a sudden outbreak of cases may be assumed if several late reports are received from health posts). If CHWs have been in place for a long time and the data they provide are unlikely to change trends, there is no harm in aggregating them with health facility data.  As the caseload decreases, data should be aggregated and reported weekly. Case reporting is easier when electronic data systems are used and are linked to a central database. The system can be further simplified by using electronic patient registers and a mechanism to automate data aggregation.  During elimination, cases must be notified immediately to the field team, and data may be transmitted as a patient line list almost daily. This is increasingly possible with open-source software such as the District Health Information System version 2 ( DHIS2 ) and increasingly cheap portable phones, tablets and computing appliances. Surveillance officers should immediately notify the district (or equivalent) team and the NMP of all confirmed cases of malaria by telephone, SMS or email. The notification should include the patient\u2019s name, village or neighbourhood and district (or equivalent) of residence, date of malaria testing, type of test and Plasmodium species. The NMP should immediately alert the local field investigation team, which should plan to investigate the case and, if necessary, focus.

Routine use of surveillance data is expected to improve both programme decision-making and the surveillance system as gaps in data completeness and quality are identified and addressed. Most national surveillance systems now use electronic systems, and programmes should use digital dashboards for analysing key indicators and trends. Details of the analysis, interpretation and use of data on malaria outbreaks and epidemics are given in    section 6    and for programme monitoring and evaluation in    section 7   .  Two examples are provided to highlight some of the considerations to be made in analysing surveillance data.  Box 2  describes the transformation of malaria case counts to incidence.    BOX 2.     Adjusting for population size: calculating incidence rates    Absolute numbers of malaria cases, inpatients and deaths can be used to estimate trends over time and to identify places in which the problem of malaria is greatest. Absolute numbers are less useful for assessing which populations are at highest risk for acquiring malaria, because most geographical units have different population sizes. For example, it is not immediately clear whether 500 cases in a population of 17 000 represents a higher risk for malaria than 300 cases in a population of 8500. To facilitate comparison of populations, the number of cases is usually expressed for a standard population of 1000 or 10 000, by dividing the number of cases by the population size and multiplying by the standard size of population desired:    Population A: 500 cases\/17 000 population x 1000 = 29.4 cases per 1000 population \t Population B: 300 cases\/8500 population x 1000 = 35.3 cases per 1000 population    Adjustment to a standard population can also take into account the growth of populations over time, which may be significant if trends in cases are examined over an extended period such as 10 years.  The denominator is generally the population at risk for malaria. This is defined as the population in areas in which there is ongoing transmission. People travelling to such areas may acquire malaria, but they are not usually included in the population at risk. For international comparisons and other situations in which information on the overall risk to populations is desired (including the risk of those not exposed to malaria), the total population of a country may be used as the denominator. If cases are broken down by age, sex or occupational group, the sizes of these groups should be used as the denominators. In elimination settings, use of the populations at risk in foci of transmission to quantify national incidence may result in incorrect classification of a country as having a high malaria incidence. In such situations, it may be better to use case counts, but care should be taken in using these data in trend analyses, as the counts may change with increasing case detection as countries undertake active surveillance.  Programme managers may be interested in knowing the size of other populations, such as those living in areas where vectors are circulating or target populations for interventions, but these figures are generally not used in calculating incidence rates.  Estimates of population size published by a relevant government department should be used; such departments include a statistical office, planning bureau or census office. The estimates are usually based on projections from censuses undertaken at intervals of about 10 years; population growth rates between censuses are used to project population sizes after the latest census. Thus, as the time of the next census approaches, the population projections may differ considerably from the actual population sizes, particularly at local level. When new census results are released, the projected populations calculated for previous years must be updated to take into account the latest \u2013 and more accurate \u2013 counts.  In the last stages of elimination, the use of the annual parasite incidence is of little value and the programme should use actual case counts.    Box 3  shows the influence of health facility attendance, diagnostic testing and reporting rates on the computation of malaria incidence rates. These issues are common, especially in areas where the goal is burden reduction, the surveillance system may not capture all malaria cases, and complete malaria confirmation with RDTs or microscopy has not yet been achieved.    BOX 3.     Influence of health facility attendance, diagnostic testing and reporting rates on reported malaria incidence rates    Crude incidence rates derived by surveillance of malaria cases take into account the size of the population but may not reflect the true incidence of malaria in a population because, as shown in the surveillance cascade:    most reports are from the public health sector; \t the proportion of patients with suspected malaria who attend public health facilities (from which most data are derived) may differ by area and over time; \t the proportion of people attending public health facilities who have a diagnostic test may differ by area and over time; and \t health facility reporting rates may differ by area.         The example below shows the results for two districts, one urban and one rural, with different rates of malaria. The crude incidence rate in the urban district is half that in the rural district, but in the urban district a larger proportion of patients seek care in public health facilities, a larger proportion receive a diagnostic test, and a larger proportion of health facilities submit monthly reports. Because of these factors, the reported incidence of malaria is higher in the urban district (14 per 1000) than in the rural one (12 per 1000).       Thus, when areas with better access to health facilities and better health facilities report a higher incidence of malaria than areas with limited access, it is advisable to examine other indicators (overall health facility use rate, percentage of people who receive a diagnostic test and completeness of health facility reporting) in interpreting the data. It may also be useful to examine other indicators, such as rates of diagnostic test positivity.  If the rates of facility use and reporting are known, incidence rates based on the numbers of malaria cases seen in health facilities can be adjusted for these factors to provide a more representative estimate of incidence    (8) .  When computing incidence, it is important that cases be linked to their places of origin and of diagnosis, especially when the burden is very low and many cases may come from outside the location of the nearest health facility."},{"nid":346,"text_data":"5.2.2.2 Granting malaria-free status  The report is reviewed by all MECP members. The country will be asked to clarify any technical issues or respond to questions. After any further clarification or supplementary information, the MECP submits its final evaluation report to the WHO MPAC with a recommendation to certify malaria elimination or to postpone it.  The WHO MPAC makes a final recommendation on granting malaria-free status in a summary report to the GMP which, in turn, informs the WHO Director-General, who makes the final decision and communicates it in an official letter to the national government. When malaria-free status is granted, the WHO publishes the information in the  Weekly epidemiological record ,  International travel and health  and the  World malaria report.  In addition, the country is listed in the official WHO  Register of areas where malaria elimination has been achieved , which was established at the request of Member States. As the Register is restricted to countries and territories that have eliminated malaria by specific measures, a supplementary list was opened in 1963 for areas in which malaria never existed or disappeared without specific measures    (42)   ."},{"nid":347,"text_data":"5.3 Follow-up of WHO certification  Certification confirms to the international community that an entire country has an adequate system for preventing re-establishment of local malaria transmission. It also demonstrates an accomplishment made possible by the necessary political will and vision, the required legislative and regulatory framework, adequate financial and administrative resources, personnel and technological capacity.  Reliable information on the global distribution of malaria is necessary to assess the risk of international travellers for exposure to malaria and the epidemiological risk of importation of malaria parasites into malaria-free areas that are receptive to transmission. Therefore, certified countries should continue to report to WHO annually on maintenance of their malaria-free status, providing information on reported malaria cases and their classification (for more information, see    Annex 9   ).  A minimum indication of possible transmission re-establishment would be the occurrence of three or more indigenous malaria infections of the same species per year in the same focus for three consecutive years. Because certification represents recognition of a considerable operational achievement, a careful national investigation and consultation with WHO will be conducted before a country\u2019s malaria-free certification status is lost. As of November 2016, no certification had been withdrawn."},{"nid":349,"text_data":"5.4.1 General principles for interested countries  Use of the term \u201csubnational certification\u201d of malaria elimination should be avoided and the term \u201csubnational verification\u201d be used instead. Subnational verification is led by countries, which assess malaria elimination in subnational areas at their discretion.  WHO can provide technical assistance to Member States, as for other aspects of malaria control and elimination. In particular, WHO can provide advice on the approach to be used; however, WHO does not have the resources to participate in verification in all countries. The processes and criteria for subnational verification should follow the WHO national certification scheme, as this will result in collection of essential information and establishment of the systems and structures required for certification of national elimination. Thus, the criteria and assessment procedures used in WHO certification of national malaria elimination are valid for subnational verification.  A clear distinction must be made between the role of national authorities, who verify, and that of local authorities in subnational areas, who are the objects of verification."},{"nid":350,"text_data":"5.4.2 Suggested process for interested countries  Subnational verification of elimination of malaria transmission should be subjected to official regulations and\/or administrative orders. A higher-level, experienced, independent national malaria elimination advisory committee should be established to monitor and verify the work of the national programme and help document it, including by publishing experiences and subnational verification milestones in the peer-reviewed literature. The advisory committee has a national political role in advocating for continuing work until the disease is eliminated.  It is recommended that subnational evaluations be conducted by independent national evaluation teams, including external international experts if possible, in order to increase their validity and credibility. The evaluation should include a review of documents on the malaria situation and the activities of the candidate administrative area, including validation of the absence of locally transmitted cases, resulting in zero incidence of indigenous cases for a statutory period (at least three consecutive years), related information and reports of field visits.  The criteria to be met to be confident that local malaria transmission has been interrupted in a given area should be defined in official regulations and should replicate WHO\u2019s criteria for national elimination as closely as possible.  The status of subnational verification of malaria elimination should be rescinded by national authorities if local transmission is re-established, i.e. the occurrence of three or more indigenous malaria cases of the same species linked in space and time, due to local mosquito-borne transmission in the same geographical focus in the same year for three or more years.  A central database on verification of subnational malaria elimination, with evaluation reports, should be created and maintained. High-quality surveillance and response should be sustained and remain efficient in the areas concerned until national certification is achieved. Countries are encouraged to report annually to WHO on subnational verification of transmission elimination, so that this information can be included in the  WHO International travel and health  and the  World malaria report ."},{"nid":353,"text_data":"6.1.1 Medicines  Substantial work is under way on new medicines to counter the resistance of vectors, to safely target hypnozoites (radical cure), to clear gametocytes and to prevent reinfection (prophylaxis).

Evaluation of operational feasibility in a few pilot areas before wide-scale implementation can indicate the appropriate strategies for the introduction and longterm sustainable use of interventions."},{"nid":359,"text_data":"6.2.2 Safety  While certain tools might have been approved and recommended by stringent regulatory authorities, evaluation of their safety might still be warranted if they are to be used at scale or in asymptomatic populations.

Evaluations of safety should take into consideration the risks and benefits of the tool in the context of use (e.g. medicines for malaria treatment and for mass drug administration)."},{"nid":360,"text_data":"6.2.3 Cost and economic measures  The cost, budgeting, financial management and cost\u2013effectiveness of prevention and treatment tools and strategies when the goal is elimination depend on the context and are often poorly understood.

The cost\u2013effectiveness of (novel) vector control measures also depends on the context. As costs may change dramatically after elimination but not be fully documented in advance, studies of the cost\u2013effectiveness of a package of elimination interventions are fundamentally different from those of control scenarios, as they require assumptions of costs and cost reductions after elimination."},{"nid":361,"text_data":"6.2.4 Other areas  Operational research can also address novel approaches that are still in the research phase, and the results can contribute to the evidence base required for national and global policy recommendations. The approaches include: (1) use of genetic epidemiology, which is being evaluated for distinguishing local from imported cases and defining the \u201cconnectivity\u201d among parasite populations regionally; and (2) use of remote sensing satellite imagery and smart phone applications for disease mapping and reporting for malaria surveillance."},{"nid":362,"text_data":"6.3 Regulatory environment for malaria elimination  The impact of new tools and technologies may be substantially reduced if uptake is slowed by regulatory processes and in-country registration. Malaria elimination programmes should proactively evaluate the product development pipeline and define the pathways necessary for regulatory approval and registration, in collaboration with national and regional regulatory authorities. It is therefore recommended that national regulatory authorities participate in the national malaria elimination advisory committee.  Certain countries require local trials of medicines for national registration, with evaluation in the epidemiological and demographic context of the country. In some cases, waivers or limited field trials can be used to ensure rapid uptake. Elimination programmes should work with national regulators to define the most appropriate, efficient pathway when local trials are required."},{"nid":363,"text_data":"2.6 Using data for making decisions in malaria control programmes  Decisions about programme policies, strategies, approaches, structures and priorities must be based on the best available data to ensure that maximum impact is achieved with the available resources, to improve the results that programmes can achieve and to enhance accountability. To produce data for decision-making, a NMP must constantly monitor critical components of programme performance, including process indicators (e.g. the number of commodities distributed and where), input indicators (e.g. the fraction of targeted households that received indoor residual spraying (IRS) and the number of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) or LLINs purchased), intermediate indicators (e.g. impact of an intervention on vectors) and outcome indicators (e.g. malaria incidence). Processes should be set up for regular validation and analysis of the collected data and the programmes adjusted in response.  Data should be collected and analysed regularly at all levels of the malaria programme and used at each level to inform actions or decisions. For example, central programme managers need information on overall performance in order to track progress and report to their government and donors. They also need measures to ensure timely distribution of pharmaceutical products and avoid stock-outs. At provincial, state or district level, malaria managers require analysis of intervention coverage in order to identify gaps, adjust strategies to cover underserved areas, identify the true focus of transmission and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. Feedback to individual health facilities should, for example, indicate their testing and reporting rates and how these rates compare with those elsewhere. Digital dashboards and regular surveillance bulletins are effective ways of monitoring these metrics. Health facilities should clearly define the extent of their catchment areas in order to link disease counts to the population accurately.  All staff should be trained in recognizing the importance of data and how they are used in decision-making. The results of analyses should be shared with those who collected the data so that they become aware of the value of the data.  Box 4  outlines approaches for disseminating and using data and information for planning. The use of data for decision-making is further discussed in    section 7   .    BOX 4.     Approaches to disseminating data      Formal meetings . If the data generated by a surveillance system are to be used to improve the operation of an NMP, managers must ensure regular opportunities for review. A schedule of meetings should be established to review malaria trends, which might include:    \u00a0community with health facility staff \u2013 monthly or quarterly; \t \u00a0health facility staff with malaria control programme staff at intermediate level (e.g. district) \u2013\u00a0 \u00a0monthly; and \t \u00a0intermediate level staff with NMP staff \u2013 quarterly performance review (meetings might have to be held less frequently or regionally in order to create opportunities for national staff to meet all intermediate staff during a year).      Supervision . Supervision by national and intermediate level is required to build an information system and to ensure the completeness of reporting, analysis and discussion of data and follow-up of recommended actions. During visits to health facilities (and CHWs) and intermediate-level team offices, supervisors should check that registers are up to date, with all fields completed, that the data on report forms correspond to the information in registers and tally sheets, that core analysis graphs and tables are up to date and that discussions are held on interpreting trends and potential action (see    Annex 14    for an example of a malaria surveillance supervisory checklist). Health facility (and CHW) staff should be encouraged to investigate all inpatient malaria cases and deaths.    Feedback . Intermediate-level managers should prepare feedback for health facilities (and CHWs) monthly or quarterly and should include private health facilities that provide data. The feedback should reflect not only the data submitted by the health facility but also comparisons with other facilities in the same administrative unit and summary statistics for the unit as a whole, including responses. A regular bulletin could be produced in a standard format for presenting district results (based on control charts) and comparisons of health facilities. Feedback can also be part of the supervision process. An example of a monthly bulletin for high- and moderate-transmission countries is shown in    Annex 15 .    A national feedback bulletin should be produced each quarter, showing indicators by relevant administrative unit (   Annex 15   ). As transmission is reduced, mapping could be extended to subunits, to present more detailed epidemiological information on remaining affected locations and population groups, and eventually to foci. The bulletin should be widely circulated, not only as feedback to health staff but also as information for the public, other government departments, institutions, implementing partners and neighbouring areas or countries. Elected leaders should also be sent the bulletin on malaria, possibly with the malaria situation shown according to political boundaries, to instil understanding and support for malaria control at the highest level."},{"nid":364,"text_data":"References  1.

Biology of malaria    1. Parasitological aspects    Malaria parasites are unicellular organisms belonging to the genus  Plasmodium . Human malaria is due to four species that cause four types of malarial disease:  P.   falciparum ,  P.   malariae ,  P .  ovale  and P.  vivax . The four human malaria species are not evenly spread across the malaria-affected areas of the world, and their relative importance varies between and within areas, by zoo-geographical region (see  Fig. A1 ).  P.  falciparum is the most common species and predominates in Africa south of the Sahara. P.  vivax  predominates in the subtropics and coexists with  P. falciparum  in tropical Asia, the tropical Americas and the Horn of Africa. P.  ovale  is found in Africa and sporadically in South-East Asia and the western Pacific. P.  malariae  has a similar geographical distribution to  P.   falciparum , but its incidence is lower and its distribution is patchy.  FIG. A1.    Spatial distribution of  P. falciparum  and  P. vivax  (1)    (a) Estimated annual mean  P. falciparum  parasite prevalence standardized to the 2\u201310-year age range, shown as a continuum of beige to brown with a range from 0% to &gt; 70% (2)       Source: Malaria Atlas Project.  (b) Estimated annual mean  P. vivax  parasite prevalence standardized across all ages, shown as a spectrum of beige to brown with a range from 0% to 7% (3)      \u00a0Note: Areas in which Duffy negative gene frequency is predicted to be &gt; 90% are shown in hatching. Darkgrey areas are those with unstable transmission (annual number of reported cases &lt; 0.1\/1000 per year).   P .  vivax  and  P. falciparum  infections cause low birth weight in neonates and are associated with anaemia and splenomegaly, particularly in children and pregnant women. Unlike other  Plasmodium  species,  P .  vivax  and  P .  ovale  can remain dormant in the liver for up to several months or even years after inoculation and cause relapses. Forms of malaria due to  P .  malariae  and  P.   ovale  are less severe and are rarely life-threatening; unlike the other malaria parasites,  P.   malariae  can remain undetected for decades and can lead to chronic immune-pathological sequelae.  The risk for contracting malaria is highly variable from country to country and even between areas in a country. The distribution of malaria in the world was widest in the late nineteenth century, since when, the area affected by malaria transmission has continued to contract.  During the past decade, cases of zoonotic  Plasmodium  infection, first and foremost with P.  knowlesi , have been reported with increasing frequency in South-East Asia, especially in Malaysia. The natural reservoirs of this species are several macaque species found in forests in South-East Asia. The main vectors belong to the  Anopheles  leucosphyrus group, which is also associated with forest environments.  Malaria parasites are transmitted by female mosquitoes belonging to the genus  Anopheles . The development of malaria parasites in the vector, called sporogony, includes a number of stages in different organs of the insect. Male and female gametocytes mate after being ingested by an anopheline mosquito during bloodfeeding. The zygotes develop as ookinetes, which move across the mosquito stomach to form oocycsts, within which asexual multiplication leads to the production of up to thousands of sporozoites. The sporozoites migrate and accumulate in the salivary glands, from which they are injected when the infective mosquito bites a human or animal host for a blood-meal.  The speed of development of sporozoites depends on temperature and the parasite species. At the optimal temperature, 28 oC, the duration of sporogony is 9\u201310 days for  P. falciparum  and 8\u201310 days for P.  vivax . The time from ingestion of gametocytes to release of sporozoites is the extrinsic incubation period (or duration of sporogony). Sporozoites injected by a mosquito enter the host\u2019s blood circulation; when they reach the liver, they invade hepatocytes. All  P. falciparum  sporozoites then undergo exoerythrocytic schizogony, in which the parasite nucleus divides repeatedly over several days; at the end, the schizont bursts, giving rise to thousands of merozoites, which are released into the bloodstream. The duration of exo-erythrocytic schizogony is 5.5\u20137 days for  P .  falciparum  and 6\u20138 days for P.  vivax . In P.  vivax  malaria, some sporozoites, after invading hepatocytes, become dormant as hypnozoites for periods lasting from 3 to 18 months and very rarely up to 5 years.  The merozoites invade erythrocytes, where the great majority multiply asexually, undergoing repeated cycles of growth, rupture, release and reinvasion of fresh red cells. All clinical manifestations of malaria are due to this erythrocytic schizogony. The duration of each cycle of erythrocytic schizogony is about 48 h for both  P .  falciparum  and P.  vivax . Some merozoites grow and develop into male or female gametocytes within erythrocytes. When mature, they do not develop further, unless they are ingested by a mosquito vector. The immature gametocytes (stages 1\u20134) of  P. falciparum  are sequestered in the bone marrow and other deep tissues; only mature gametocytes (stage 5) circulate in the blood. In contrast, all stages of gametocytes of the three other species are present in the peripheral circulation.  The transmission cycle of malaria is represented in  Fig. A2.    FIG. A2.    Malaria transmission cycle         The duration of the biological processes mentioned above is not observed directly in clinical or public health practice. It is, however, possible to define a number of critical, observable intervals that depend on these elementary processes. For example, the clinical incubation period is equal to the duration of exo-erythrocytic schizogony plus the time required for a build-up of the parasite density above the pyrogenic threshold, which may take one or more cycles of erythrocytic schizogony. These observable intervals are of great importance for determining from a patient\u2019s history whether the case was imported or contracted locally and for how many days it may have been infective to vectors in a given area. The intervals are summarized in  Table A1  for P.  falciparum  and P.  vivax . They should be taught during training of field staff and included in standard operating procedures for case and focus investigation.  TABLE A1.    Duration of critical observable intervals for the two main species of human malaria parasite         All values are from (6), except times to appearance and disappearance of gametocytes, from (7).    2. Entomological aspects    There are about 515 species of  Anopheles  mosquito in the world. Approximately 70 can transmit malaria, and, of these, 30\u201340 are vectors of major importance. Each species has a different pattern of behaviour. Most areas harbour multiple species of  Anopheles , and different ones occur in different parts of the world.  The life cycle of the mosquito has four distinct stages: egg, larva, pupa and adult. The development periods of the various stages depend on the ambient temperature and nutritional factors and are shorter at higher temperatures. A blood-meal is necessary for maturation of the eggs.    Vector efficiency  refers to how effective a given species is as a vector, irrespective of its density. This measure is determined mainly by the following properties of mosquitoes:    vector competence: the ability of a mosquito species to transmit a given parasite species; \t longevity: expressed as the probability of a female mosquito surviving through one day (24 h); \t anthropophily: the proportion of a given vector\u2019s feed on humans, measured as the human blood index; and \t gonotrophic period: the interval between two oviposition cycles; the shorter the interval, the higher the biting frequency and hence vector efficiency.      Vectorial capacity  is defined as the number of new malaria infections that the population of a given vector would cause per day at a given place and time, assuming that the human population is and remains fully susceptible. Vectorial capacity depends on inherent characteristics of vector species (biting time and host preference), density, human-biting rate and longevity, which are affected by the ambient temperature and relative humidity, as well as insecticides    Transmission intensity  can be considered a function of two main components: first, the mosquito-related factors that determine the vectorial capacity (probability of an infection being transmitted from an infectious person on any given day) and, second, the detection- and treatment-related factors that determine for how long an infection persists to contribute to transmission (gametocyte carriage rate). Of note, symptomatic infections (typically with higher parasite densities) are significantly more infectious to mosquitoes; thus, early detection of illness, testing and treatment may be critical in reducing transmission. Areas with higher vectorial capacity and low treatment rates will tend to have the highest transmission rates, as infections in these areas will remain untreated for a long time, resulting in a high probability of transmission to mosquitoes and humans throughout that time. Knowing whether transmission intensity is driven more by low treatment rates or by high vectorial capacity may suggest which interventions are likely to have the most impact (e.g. strengthening surveillance with treatment versus increasing coverage with vector control)."},{"nid":367,"text_data":"References  1.

Surveillance systems may at this stage be integrated with broader disease surveillance systems. Nationwide early detection and prompt treatment of imported malaria cases that could result in reestablishment of transmission and monitoring of changes in receptivity and vulnerability should be a priority. The probability that malaria will become re-established differs by area, as follows.    When the receptivity or vulnerability of an area is 0, there is no risk for re-establishment of transmission. \t In areas with low receptivity and vulnerability, early case detection by a vigilant general health service, complemented by epidemiological investigation of every suspected local case and focus of origin and rapid, appropriate curative and preventive measures, may be sufficient to prevent re-establishment of transmission. Within and between country cross-border surveillance becomes important to reduce risks of importation. \t In areas with higher receptivity and vulnerability, it may be necessary to supplement these activities with ACD, which could be combined with other regular activities involving house visits. \t In localities that are highly receptive and highly vulnerable, it may be necessary to reduce receptivity during the transmission season by using timely, targeted vector control measures, including IRS and, where applicable, larviciding.

Gaining such certification involves a review of national documentation and field visits to recent transmission foci to verify that there have been no indigenous malaria cases. A field evaluation is mandatory, in order to confirm that the national surveillance system could detect local transmission should it occur and that a funded programme for prevention of re-establishment is in place. The complete list of documents required is available in the WHO manual  Framework for malaria elimination  (5)   . The documents related to surveillance are:    complete information on cases and active malaria foci in the 5 years before the last identified indigenous case (by species), with supporting maps; \t the national malaria case register with case investigation forms for all cases for at least the previous 5 years; \t annual malaria surveillance reports for the past 10 years; \t reports of quality assurance of diagnostic methods; and \t detailed reports on entomological and vector control activities.    Subnational verification of malaria elimination is an option for large countries that have achieved interruption of local transmission in certain parts of their territory, such as major cities or geographically isolated territories (e.g. islands). Subnational verification enables large countries to \u201cshrink the map\u201d of malaria endemicity by epidemiological stratum. The documentation required for subnational verification is similar to that for national certification and will thus form part of the evidence for elimination certification. Although subnational verification means that parts of a country can be declared malaria-free by the government, certification applies only nationally. WHO does not certify subnational elimination.  Once a country has been certified by the WHO as malaria-free, information on malaria cases detected, by species, classification and origin, and brief histories of all reported introduced and indigenous cases, if any, should be submitted to WHO annually to prove that transmission has not been re-established."},{"nid":382,"text_data":"3.1 Case definitions  A  suspected case of malaria  is one in which an individual has an illness suspected by a health worker of being due to malaria, generally on the basis of the presence of fever with or without other symptoms. This suspicion triggers the process of parasitological confirmation by microscopy or RDT and a subsequent decision about whether to treat the individual for malaria.  All suspected malaria cases should be confirmed parasitologically  (5) .  When malaria diagnosis is not available and confirmation is not possible but a case of malaria is suspected and is treated as such, the case should be reported as a presumed malaria case. Criteria must be established in national treatment guidelines for defining which patients who attend health facilities (public or private) or CHWs should be given a parasitological test. All suspected, presumed, tested and positive cases must be reported through the surveillance system.  Common criteria for suspecting malaria include:    for residents of endemic areas (high to low transmission) and active foci in elimination areas: patients with fever or a recent history of fever; and, \t for residents of non-endemic areas with very low transmission or maintaining 0 transmission: patients with unexplained fever and a history of travel to an area at risk of malaria, either within the country or abroad.    More specific categories in areas of active elimination are:    all febrile patients in an active foci, especially during the transmission season; \t \u00a0people with a history of malaria in the past 3 years and fever or recent history of fever; \t \u00a0people who had fever within 1 year of visiting a malaria-endemic area (domestic or foreign),\u00a0 \u00a0sometimes extended to 3 years for areas of risk for  P. vivax ; \t \u00a0patients with fever, malaise and chills; \t \u00a0people with anaemia of unknown cause; \t \u00a0patients with fever of unknown etiology; \t \u00a0patients with hepatomegaly or splenomegaly (or both); and \t \u00a0recipients of blood donations who have fever during the 3 months after transfusion.    The established criteria should be disseminated to all health providers and the public, and the programme should provide periodic reminders.    A case of uncomplicated malaria  is that in a patient with symptomatic malaria parasitaemia without signs of severity or evidence of vital organ dysfunction    (17)   .    \u00a0In areas where the main aim is to reduce the burden of disease and deaths, a malaria case is often considered to be that in a person with malaria infection, confirmed by microscopy or RDT, accompanied by clinical symptoms such as fever. \t \u00a0Febrile illness may be due to other causes. The majority of fevers are not due to malaria in populations that have acquired immunity to malaria but also in areas where there is little malaria transmission. A case of fever and parasitological confirmation by microscopy or RDT should, however, still be classified as malaria. If a concurrent disease is suspected, it should be further investigated and treated. \t Data on confirmed cases recorded in outpatient registers are used as a proxy for uncomplicated malaria for surveillance purposes. In addition, in elimination settings, individuals with malaria infection detected during ACD but who not have severe symptoms are considered to have uncomplicated malaria. \t \u00a0In areas of elimination, all malaria infections are important because they may lead to onward transmission. Therefore, all patients with parasitaemia are considered \u201cmalaria cases\u201d, regardless of whether clinical symptoms are present. \t Some patients who test negative by microscopy or RDT may have very low levels of parasitaemia that are detectable only by more sensitive techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a highly sensitive test for detecting very small amounts of genetic material from parasites. Such levels of parasitaemia are generally considered not to be clinically significant in most settings; however, their contribution to sustaining transmission remains inconclusive, and diagnostic testing with microscopy or a standard RDT should allow adequate tracking of malaria trends. Tests might have to be repeated if no other cause of fever is identified and the symptoms continue.      A case of severe malaria  is that in a person with the clinical and laboratory features listed in section 7 of the WHO  Guidelines for the treatment of malaria  (17)      For surveillance purposes, inpatient malaria cases are considered a proxy for severe malaria    (17)   . (Some countries with low transmission and in the elimination phase might, however, admit uncomplicated malaria cases to hospital to ensure full adherence to treatment or radical cure.)    A death of which the primary cause is complications of severe malaria is considered a death due to malaria. \t The numbers of inpatient malaria cases and deaths should be taken from the register of discharges in which malaria is the confirmed primary diagnosis or from ward books if discharge registers are not available. \t In settings in which the aim is to reduce the burden, some malaria cases and deaths may be missed if overall use of the health sector is low. In such cases, the numbers of inpatients and deaths at all hospitals and health centres should be reported. \t In all transmission settings, malaria deaths should be notified to higher levels of the health system for investigation and response. In areas of elimination, all cases and deaths must be notified and investigated immediately.    Appropriate quality-assured diagnostic and laboratory support must be available for accurate management and classification of malaria. Further details are provided in the  WHO Parasitological confirmation of malaria diagnosis  (18) , Malaria microscopy quality assurance manual  (19)   and  the Methods manual for product testing of malaria rapid diagnostic tests  (20) ."},{"nid":384,"text_data":"3.2.1 Passive case detection  If the population has good access to health services (public, private, nongovernmental organization or community services), the majority of cases will be identified early by PCD and treated to reduce the risks of severe disease and death and may also contribute to reducing transmission. In elimination settings, PCD should cover the whole population, including those living or working in remote areas or who are hard to reach, to ensure coverage with rapid testing, treatment and reporting.  High-quality coverage with PCD is therefore a critical prerequisite for reducing the burden of and eliminating malaria. Programmes should map or otherwise determine whether there are communities located in receptive areas (i.e. with competent vectors, a suitable climate and a susceptible population) that are far from public health facilities and add additional health posts, CHWs or volunteers to those locations, to extend the reach of the PCD network. Optimizing PCD should be a priority of national programmes in terms of access to care and surveillance."},{"nid":385,"text_data":"3.2.2 Active case detection  ACD is important in elimination programmes for detecting symptomatic cases that are not detected by PCD and asymptomatic cases in the community. ACD surveillance systems, with case detection, notification and investigation, should be established in all elimination areas when the caseload is very low but should not be considered a substitute for optimizing PCD. As in PCD, all cases identified by ACD should undergo full quality-assured testing and treatment, be followed up to confirm clearance of the infection if part of the RACD process and be reported to the health information system.  ACD is conducted intermittently outside health facilities (including village health posts) by health workers who visit patients at their houses, workplaces, schools or other locations, such as markets. Thus, periodic (e.g. monthly) visits to mining camps by a health team would be considered ACD, as there is no fixed facility and no regular service between health worker visits. Cases detected by CHWs are considered to be detected passively if the patients visit a CHW\u2019s home for consultation but detected actively if they are identified by a CHW at regular visits to patients\u2019 houses. ACD may also involve parasitological examination of everyone in a targeted population (mass testing), whereas in PCD only symptomatic cases are usually tested. In some countries, pregnant women may be routinely tested for malaria at antenatal care clinics, even when they have no obvious symptoms; any case identified should therefore be considered as passively detected.  ACD is further classified into proactive case detection (PACD) and reactive case detection (RACD). PACD is undertaken in populations that have limited access to facilities or inadequate health-seeking behaviour and in high-risk groups (e.g. remote and\/or migrant populations, refugees, armed forces, forest workers, long-distance drivers). PACD is not prompted by an index case and is performed regularly at specific times (mainly during the transmission season) to confirm active local transmission in target populations and to detect cases early. RACD may be undertaken in response to an index case, the epidemiological characteristics of which trigger additional ACD, in which a household or a population potentially linked to the case is tested or screened for symptoms and tested before treatment. Index cases are usually seen at a health facility. ACD for  P. vivax  and  P. ovale  malaria may still miss a substantial proportion of cases because hypnozoites cannot be detected with current testing methods. As the majority of relapses occur within the first 3 months of infection with  P. vivax  or  P. ovale , it is advisable to combine RACD with PACD conducted at appropriate intervals, especially during peak transmission seasons.  Typically during both PACD and RACD, all members of the households within a circumscribed area (around the index case in the case of RACD) would receive a parasitological test with or without screening on the basis of a history of fever, other malaria-related symptoms and travel history. If the index case is imported, RACD should also be done among fellow travellers.  Box 5  gives guidance on conducting malaria ACD during house-to-house visits in transmission foci.    BOX 5. Organizing ACD by house-to-house visits      In RACD, a visit is triggered by the report of a single or a cluster of index cases in a focus. For PACD, visits are made intermittently to determine the presence and extent of transmission among identified high-risk groups in areas with ongoing transmission or populations living in highly receptive foci where transmission has recently been interrupted. PACD may also be used as a complement to RACD in areas where  P. vivax  is the dominant parasite or in rare cases where you have  P. ovale , to ensure that as many as possible of relapsing cases are identified in good time. \t RACD is done when there are few cases (e.g. no more than three cases per week per investigation team) and few remaining foci of transmission. \t Local health care providers or mobile teams list the targeted population by household (and map them with a GPS when possible), with the assistance of local authorities. The target population should be completely covered. People working in organizations associated with the target population should be included in the lists, such as transport workers, development project workers and the military. People living in outlying hamlets, who may not be recorded on household lists, should also be covered. All efforts should be made to include people living clandestinely in the target area, such as illegal immigrants. For RACD, the target population may be determined as that within a radius around the index case. \t A plan of visits is prepared, and the targeted population is informed of the dates and times they will be visited. It is important to obtain community participation and support for this activity through visits, contact with local leaders and the mass media. PACD may be done once a month during the high-transmission season and may or may not be complemented by RACD, depending on the caseload. ACD should be done only when there are very few cases and foci of transmission. \t ACD is conducted when family members are most likely to be at home (i.e. before or after work, in the early evening) or at school. Markets, religious places and other community structures might be used in order to cover the whole targeted population. \t ACD is usually conducted by mass testing of household members. When this is not operationally feasible (e.g. when diagnostic and human resources or drugs are limited), or needed (as in near-elimination settings when the vast majority of cases are symptomatic), household members may be asked about recent fever, and those with a history of fever or who are febrile on the day of the visit are tested. There is no fixed rule for the recall period; 14 days (currently used in standardized surveys for malaria control) is probably suitable in most settings. Body temperature can be recorded, but this is not essential. \t Testing is done with an RDT or microscopy. Blood slides should be examined on the same or the following day at a local laboratory, if possible (otherwise, the slide should be sent to the nearest laboratory). If the interval between blood sampling and examination is more than 1 day, care must be taken to avoid fixation of erythrocytes in the thick films (as may occur in hot weather); for example, slides should be haemolysed as soon as the film is completely dry, or dried slides should be stored in a cool box. Thick blood films must be protected from flies. \t Any person in a clinically severe state should be assisted in obtaining medical care, whether or not he or she has malaria. \t People found to have malaria are treated immediately, and cases and foci are investigated epidemiologically. Treated cases are followed up to ensure complete cure. \t A register of all people whose blood was taken during ACD is completed. The register includes the identification number of the household and, for the head of the household, address, name, age and information on risk factors (e.g. occupation, ownership and use of an ITN and IRS in the past year), date blood taken, type of testing and results (species, and where possible stage, density and presence of gametocytes)."},{"nid":387,"text_data":"3.3.1 Locally acquired cases  A locally acquired case is one that is due to mosquito-borne transmission and is acquired within the area of investigation (e.g. country, district or focus). Such cases are also known as \u201cautochthonous\u201d. The two types of locally acquired malaria cases are:    indigenous: any case contracted locally, with no strong evidence of a direct link to an imported case; and \t introduced: any case contracted locally, with strong epidemiological evidence linking it directly to a known imported case (first generation from an imported case; i.e. the mosquito was infected by a patient classified as an imported case). There is limited practical value in classifying cases as introduced in areas of known transmission.    It is difficult to differentiate between introduced and indigenous cases. Both indicate local transmission, showing that malaria control was not strong enough to interrupt transmission. Indigenous transmission is more serious, because it indicates that neither prevention nor treatment contained the spread of malaria beyond the first-generation (introduced) case. Prompt treatment may not prevent first-generation transmission in all circumstances but should prevent second-generation transmission by destroying gametocytes.  The following criteria are used to classify a case as \u201cintroduced\u201d.    The case can be linked to a single imported case. Generally, the imported case will have been identified during PCD or case investigations in the focus. \t Possible transmission pathways and incubation period for all confirmed cases by type of parasite is determined by investigators during case investigations. \t If the patient is considered to have a recent infection but has no travel history that suggests importation and resides in the same household as an imported case or within a 1-km radius (or equivalent anopheline mosquito flight range) of an imported case, the case can be classified as introduced. \t If in doubt, cases should be classified as \u201cindigenous\u201d. In active foci with a relatively large number of cases, there is limited value in determining whether a case is introduced, and all cases should be considered indigenous.    Some locally acquired cases may be recrudescent or relapsing and thus not indicate ongoing local transmission. Some countries may not be able to genotype the parasites in all infected individuals in order to define recrudescence. For operational purposes, it may be sufficient to consider a case as recrudescent if the episode of malaria is due to the same species as the first episode and occurred within 30 days (for  P. falciparum ) or 60 days (for  P. vivax ) of documented noncompliance with treatment with the first-line medicine."},{"nid":388,"text_data":"3.3.2 Imported cases  An imported case is one that is due to mosquito-borne transmission and is acquired outside the area in which it was detected, in a known malarious area to or from which the patient has travelled outside the elimination area. In areas with ongoing local transmission, elimination programmes should reserve the category \u201cimported\u201d for \u201cexotic\u201d parasite species and recent arrivals from endemic countries. For all other cases occurring during the transmission season, it is prudent to assume a local origin of the infection, unless there is strong evidence to suggest otherwise.  Uncertainty may arise in classifying cases as \u201cimported\u201d rather than \u201cintroduced\u201d or \u201cindigenous\u201d when the patient has a dubious travel history or suffers a relapse of a  P. vivax  or  P. ovale  infection that was acquired earlier and was not radically cured. If the evidence is unclear, the classification that reflects more local transmission should be assigned; for example, cases should be classified as \u201cintroduced\u201d or \u201cindigenous\u201d rather than \u201cimported\u201d. This conservative classification ensures that malaria elimination programmes are more responsive to possible renewed transmission on their national territory. Often, the investigative skills of the lead epidemiologist are put to the test in determining where and when in the country an infection was acquired. Guidance provided in  Box 6  may help the investigation team in case classification. In this scheme, \u201cimported\u201d includes locally imported cases, that is, cases in which infection occurred in areas outside the focus but in the same country. For global reporting, such as to WHO, cases should be classified as imported only if the infection was acquired in another country.  A common mistake is to assume that a case is imported because the patient visited a country or area known to be endemic for the parasite species in question. Most malaria-endemic countries, however, contain large areas in which there is no risk of transmission and seasons during which no transmission takes place. It is essential to determine exactly where the patient stayed and when before concluding whether he or she could have been exposed to malaria abroad. If such detailed information on the country visited is not in the public domain (e.g. in the  country list ) ,  the NMP can request the assistance of WHO in obtaining the information or can contact the equivalent organization in the country in question directly.    BOX 6. Operational aspects of classification of cases    Correct epidemiological classification of malaria cases is crucial in malaria elimination when there are very few cases, because it is the basis for classifying foci and for selecting surveillance and other control measures.    Distinguishing between  \u201cimported\u201d and local cases  The probability that a case was imported is associated with several factors, which should be weighed in making the final assessment, as outlined below.    The timing of travel to and from endemic areas to determine how long they stayed:\t   The usual delay between an infectious mosquito bite and a primary clinical attack is 7\u201330 days. The minimal incubation period (i.e. from inoculation to onset of symptoms) of malaria in humans is about 7 days for  P.   falciparum  and 10 days for  P. vivax  infection. Thus, detection of malaria parasites within 0\u20137 days for  P.   falciparum  or 0\u201310 days for  P. vivax  of arrival in country would indicate that the person was infected before arriving. \t\t People who have lived in malaria-free areas for 2 or more years and have low immunity to malaria are highly likely to have clinical symptoms shortly after the usual incubation period. \t\t When the time between returning from travel to an endemic area and detection of malaria infection increases beyond 6 months, the probability that the case is truly due to an imported infection starts to decrease and the probability that the case is due to local transmission increases. \t   \t The parasite species:\t     P. falciparum  infections can last for 18\u201324 months, but several febrile episodes would be expected during that period, because parasite density increases intermittently to cause fever or symptomatic illness. Predominantly asymptomatic long-term infections are unlikely to occur in people with low antimalarial immunity, but they are possible. \t\t   P. vivax  infections due to activation of hypnozoites can cause infection up to 5 years after the previous infection or clinical episode but are most likely within 3 years. Experience in many countries shows that nearly 50% of imported cases occur within 1 month of arrival back in the country of residence and up to 75% by 3 months    (22)   . \t   \t The probability of local transmission in the areas of residence and occupation of the patient:\t   If a person lives and works in a place in which there has been no local malaria transmission for many years, with adequate surveillance, and the person travelled to an area of known transmission within 6 months of documented infection, classification of the case as \u201cimported\u201d is straightforward. \t\t If the area has had no malaria for more than 3 years and has reasonable surveillance or has no known appropriate vectors, local transmission is unlikely. \t\t If the malaria patient lived in a focus with recent local transmission (classified as \u201cresidual non-active\u201d focus), the probability that the case is truly \u201cimported\u201d is lower. \t\t Cases in areas with local transmission (classified as \u201cactive\u201d foci) should rarely (or never) be classified as \u201cimported\u201d. In cross-border areas with frequent population movement, especially for routine treatment-seeking, it may be programmatically useful to ensure careful classification of importation, even in active foci, so as to alert authorities across the border. \t   \t The extent of surveillance in the area in which the case was detected and the extent and quality of the field investigation around the home and work area of the case:\t   Consistently negative test results from strong previous surveillance and extensive blood sampling during the field investigation decrease the probability of local transmission."},{"nid":389,"text_data":"3.3.3 Induced cases  An induced case is one that is not due to mosquito-borne transmission but to a blood transfusion or other form of parenteral inoculation of the parasite. Such cases are easy to classify if the person lives and works in an area in which there has been no known transmission for many years and has a history of blood transfusion or other exposure to blood that could have transmitted malaria. The incubation period (i.e. the delay before onset of clinical symptoms) after contamination with infected blood from a needle-stick injury ranges from 4 to 17 days, with a median of 12 days. Induced cases never give rise to clinical relapses, because there are no liver-stage parasites."},{"nid":390,"text_data":"3.4 Focus classification  The heterogeneity of malaria across the continuum of transmission results, in most settings, in spatial clusters of relatively higher transmission, which can be referred to practically as foci of transmission. For the purpose of malaria surveillance, however, the term \u201cfocus\u201d is used mainly to refer to the few definable areas in which transmission persists during the final stages of elimination. A \u201c focus \u201d is a defined, circumscribed area situated in a currently or formerly malarious area that contains the epidemiological and ecological factors necessary for malaria transmission. A focus can be classified into one of three types ( Table 3 ); the relations among different types of focus are shown in  Fig. 9 . Focus classifications should be updated periodically. In countries with seasonal transmission, focus classifications are often reviewed at the end of each malaria transmission season or annually. The status of a focus should also be reviewed as new cases appear and field investigations are undertaken. The results of focus investigations are maintained at subnational and national levels (comprising a focus \u201cregister\u201d), and a summary of the status of foci is updated at least annually (   Annex 4   ). Where an indigenous case is reported in a cleared or residual non-active focus, the focus should immediately be classified as active to trigger prompt response (see  Fig. 9 ).    TABLE 3.

The collection of a detailed history of an index case at a fixed point of care (health facility or CHW) is the basis of initial case investigation  (Fig. 12) . Recording of detailed patient history is an integral part of surveillance for elimination and should be implemented at the fixed points of care even when a case will not be followed up in the community. Follow-up of a case to ensure compliance with treatment and complete cure is also part of case investigation.  In practice, case investigations in the focus should be done as part of RACD when the total case burden in a country is very low (for example, no more than three cases per investigation team per week), there are few foci of transmission and adequate resources are available; in particular, skilled personnel are required at peripheral level, with adequate transport and malaria commodities.  The timing of case investigations depends on the dominant parasite species; patients with  P. vivax  infection may develop gametocytes and be infectious to the mosquito before symptoms appear, requiring rapid intervention. The investigator should be aware that some patients may have hypnozoites and the case may be due to relapse. Countries should decide on the best timing of investigations, recognizing that delays in case notification and in case and focus investigations and response could result in severe disease and death, increased transmission or reintroduction of transmission, depending on the focus class and type of parasite. The investigation team should ideally initiate an investigation within 1\u20133 days of notification of a malaria case at the home or workplace of the index case.  Once the case investigation is complete at the household of the index case, a determination is made of the likely source and time of infection and the case is classified ( Fig. 12 )."},{"nid":394,"text_data":"3.6.2 Reactive case detection (RACD)  RACD is triggered by the identification and notification of an index case. After the investigation and classification of the index case, RACD may be implemented within the household of the index case, or over a radius around the household or within the whole focus ( Fig. 12 ). RACD may be undertaken for the following reasons:    to investigate an outbreak (an above-normal number of index cases) in any type of focus; \t in active foci, to ensure high coverage of case management; \t in all types of focus when a local case is due to a unusual parasite, which was either previously eliminated or is new to the focus; \t to identify locally acquired or imported cases in residual non-active or cleared but receptive foci; and \t to reclassify cases (and eventually foci) from active to residual nonactive to cleared and to verify that elimination has been achieved subnationally or nationally.    The process of RACD involves the following steps:    obtain epidemiological data on previous cases in the same focus, including age, sex, occupation, timing and species involved, and maps of the locations of cases (by house and village). These data should be available from existing records and should be prepared before the start of the investigation. Information of the index case(s) should also be available. \t register all residents of households in which RACD is to be conducted to ensure complete detection and coverage of other interventions. \t identify the household (or other likely origin\/location of infection) of the index case on the basis of information from villagers, village health volunteers and the map of the focus. \t sensitize the household (or co-workers) about malaria, its symptoms, cause, prevention and where to go for care. \t complete a case investigation form for each confirmed malaria case (see example in    Annex 2   ). The form contains demographic information, including workplace(s); the history of the current illness, including diagnostic test results and treatment; use of preventive interventions; travel history and details of fellow travellers; where, how and from whom the infection might have been acquired. It concludes with a section for classification of the case (to be filled in once the case investigation has been completed). The form must record the dates of all aspects of the travel and clinical history. An assessment of the likely location and source of infection is made and the case is classified. \t obtain information on potential malaria vectors in the vicinity of the case, if available sentinel site data are not sufficient (see    section 5.5   ). \t undertake ACD in populations considered likely to harbour parasites, usually those within a defined radius of the index case. When resources permit, the whole focus should be covered, as there may be cases of malaria outside the immediate vicinity of the index case. Fever could be used to screen populations for testing, or mass testing could be conducted. The extent of ACD will depend on the factors listed in  Box 7 . PACD may be repeated each month after RACD during the peak transmission season to ensure all new infections are detected and treated. \t where evidence shows no receptivity to malaria, there is no need to investigate imported cases at community level; however, fellow travellers of the imported index case might be tracked to provide treatment. If co-travellers are from a focus outside of the operational area of an investigation team, the appropriate authority should be informed to investigate these cases.      BOX 7. Factors that determine the extent of RACD in a field investigation      Epidemiological situation . Index cases considered to be due to local transmission may trigger geographically more extensive RACD. An apparently imported, relapsing or recrudescent case, especially in an area with low receptivity, might trigger more limited case detection; however, it is always better to err on the side of caution \u2013 if local transmission is at all possible, it is advisable to undertake RACD, at least in the surrounding cluster of households.    Receptivity  (presence of abundant anopheline vectors and other ecological and climatic factors that favour malaria transmission). Highly receptive areas should always be covered by RACD.    Type and degree of vulnerability  (proximity to a malarious area or frequent influx of infected individuals or groups or infective anophelines). Vulnerability guides both the type and the extent of RACD in each area or subpopulation.    Type and extent of clustering.  Local or national knowledge about the pattern of clustering of infection and local experience with the vectors\u2019 ecology and breeding sites will determine whether to plan geographically wider or narrower RACD.    Breeding sites . Knowledge of likely breeding sites in the area or locality may result in wider or more focused RACD.    History of infection.  History of infection in the area and the type of focus (active, residual non-active and cleared; see section 3.4) will influence the type and extent of RACD. When the index case is the first in a new active focus, less will be known about the focus and its population, and widescale RACD of febrile and non-febrile infected residents may be required to characterize the situation thoroughly and to establish a baseline. If the index case is one of many cases in the same locality in the current transmission season in a well-known focus, RACD may be more targeted, because the at-risk populations will already be known.    Location of the infection.  The hypothesized source of infection (work site or residence) will influence the type and targeting of RACD.    Resources.  The amount of resources available will guide the type of RACD; for example, screening people with a recent symptomatic illness versus mass testing. The aim is to optimize the use of available resources and complete the investigation within a short time, such as 7 days.    Parasite species:  There is currently no method for detecting liverstage malaria infections. Radical cure of individuals with such parasites is required to clear the liver stage.    Awareness : Regularly repeated RACD will increase case detection and will teach the population to use the free services at the local clinic for parasitological examination in all cases of fever, for compliance with drug doses prescribed and use of preventive interventions.  From reference    (21)   ."},{"nid":395,"text_data":"3.6.3 Focus investigation  A focus investigation is conducted to identify the main features of a location, including the populations at greatest risk, the rates of infection or disease, the distribution of vectors responsible for malaria transmission and the underlying conditions that support it. Such an investigation therefore involves demographic, epidemiological, entomological and environmental surveillance (see    section 5.5   ) and monitoring of intervention coverage and quality  ( section 7 ) . The delineation of transmission areas into foci is of practical value only if it results in few foci of relatively small size, so that their investigation is operationally feasible. Delineation that results in hundreds of foci in an area probably indicates that malaria transmission is still widely established, and the area may not be suitable for focus investigation or response. For operational purposes during elimination, a focus is of the same size as a small village, where households are separated by short distances. This allows completion of a focus investigation in a day or two. Urban foci may be smaller, given the high density of population per area. The process of case investigation at the household and RACD or PACD in the community are part of the epidemiological components of a focus investigation. However, focus investigations may not involve community case investigations or detection and could be implemented on their own to understand entomological, environmental, intervention determinants of transmission. In general, the following conditions necessitate further focus investigations:    investigation to determine causes of unusual increase in cases; \t investigation linked to RACD when cases are very few (see   section 3.6.2   ) to determine if additional response is required. If an investigation was undertaken in an active focus recently (e.g. within the past 4 weeks), it may not be necessary to conduct full focus investigation in response to an index case, although case investigations and RACD may still be done. \t investigation following the identification of a rare parasite in the focus to determine extent and cause of transmission; \t investigation following the identification of a local case in a residual non-active or cleared focus to determine extent and cause of transmission; \t routine investigations to monitor coverage of interventions in a focus.    The timing of a focus investigation depends on the parasite species. ACD linked to an index case should preferably be completed within, for example, 7 days of case notification. During a focus investigation, the relevant form should be completed  ( Annex 3 ).  The district- or intermediate-level malaria focal point is responsible for ensuring that all foci are investigated and that reports for all foci (sometimes called \u201cfocus passports\u201d) are available and kept up to date. In some settings, the focus investigation team may be in a health facility. If a focus encompasses the boundaries of two or more districts, provinces or even countries, collaboration will be required to eliminate transmission. \u201cStraddling foci\u201d are often the most puzzling for epidemiologists, because administrative boundaries may make the sources of infection difficult to determine.  A map should be drawn or digitally produced, with standard and recognizable keys, to show:    geographical features relevant for malaria transmission (e.g. rivers, rice fields, dams, ponds, forests, roads, altitude); \t the locations of all households, highlighting those in which cases have been detected in the previous 3 years (with the parasite species responsible for each case); \t vector breeding places and possible sites of transmission, especially when larval source management (LSM) is used; \t the location of test and treatment sites, including areas and households where ACD has been undertaken; and \t distribution and coverage of vector control interventions.    Both paper and electronic maps can be used, but the latter are more flexible and easier to update, given the increased availability of mapping technology (including on mobile devices) and the extension of routine information systems to be \u201cmap enabled\u201d. Additional features relevant to malaria transmission and control, such as the location of health facilities, should be added.  Geolocation is used to gather the coordinates (often longitude and latitude) of a specific location. Addition of mapping or geolocation capability to a surveillance system makes case and focus investigations more efficient and the products of data analysis more visually powerful, so that they can reveal potentially important geographical variation in both risks and risk factors. Methods used to geolocate and map malaria cases to household level include:    integrating a malaria surveillance system with an automated mapping system to geolocate detected cases in known locations; \t collecting the coordinates of individual malaria cases with a global positioning system (GPS)-enabled device after they have been detected and geolocating the residence, regardless of the location of infection, as the patient may have infected vectors before receiving radical treatment; and \t if case coordinates cannot be acquired, obtaining information from the patient about relevant location(s), such as residence, work or other places in which he or she may have been infected, which can then be plotted on a map and the coordinates read; geolocation with this method is less certain than the other two approaches.    Once malaria cases have been geolocated, they should be displayed on a map to identify possible transmission areas and to classify cases and foci to guide further targeted investigations. The boundaries of a focus should include the area in which transmission is occurring if the focus is active and in which there is a risk for onward transmission from the detected case(s), whether locally acquired or imported. Geographical reconnaissance involves gathering detailed data for planning and implementing responses and ensuring optimal coverage of all activities, especially vector control within the focus.    Annex 5    lists the stages, purpose and activities at each stage of geographical reconnaissance and focus mapping with geographical information systems (GIS).  An example of a map of a focus showing the GPS locations of households and the malaria cases detected is shown in  Fig. 13.    Once the case and focus investigations have been completed, the following actions are necessary.    The malaria focal point and the entomologist determine whether local transmission is occurring and decide on a final classification of the case and focus. \t The malaria focal point, in consultation with district and national experts, prepares a response plan based on the results of the field and focus investigations, including the entomological evaluation when relevant. \t Copies of the completed case forms and the results of the investigation (including from ACD) and foci register are distributed to the NMP, the national malaria laboratory, the reporting district team and the reporting health facility.      FIG. 13. A focus map showing the distribution of households geolocated by GPS, roads and river         The maps and household checklists produced during focus mapping should be used to target responses in the transmission focus (e.g. treatment or vector control). All the information should be in the form of both a visual guide for field officers to reach the locations where work is required and a checklist for field officers to ensure that all populations, structures and other features (e.g. potential breeding locations) are reached or covered.  Data on field activities should be recorded on household checklists and map data. The data can then be updated and analysed in applications such as GIS software to assess and evaluate the coverage of interventions and activities conducted (as illustrated in  Fig. 5 ). Data should include the locations of additional malaria cases detected by RACD, the coverage of vector control activities or the location of breeding sites. Programmes should maintain and regularly update inventories of transmission foci. Customized applications (e.g. integrated malaria surveillance systems) could be designed to permit malaria programmes to analyse intervention data rapidly and automatically, to ensure that all activities within the transmission focus are conducted with optimal coverage and on time."},{"nid":396,"text_data":"3.7 Focus response  Most interventions in a focus are implemented routinely ( Fig. 11 ) and the response to an index case or PACD during the high transmission season are mechanism to optimize these interventions or respond to unusual situations. Providing treatment to infected individuals, supplementary vector control and increasing community awareness are part of the focus response during house-to-house visits during RACD. The responses in active, residual non-active and cleared foci are similar but have important differences.    Vector control measures are assessed for their appropriateness, coverage and use in accordance with the local context of malaria, with particular attention to the receptivity of the area. \t PCD services are accessible to all members of the population throughout the year and are supported by supervision at defined intervals. \t In active foci, there are several options. High coverage of appropriate vector control should be ensured. Population-wide treatment (MDA) or possibly PACD (with screening and testing or with testing alone) could be considered at appropriate intervals, especially just before or during the transmission season. If a testing approach is chosen but no cases are found after several rounds of PACD, the frequency may be reduced or the strategy changed to RACD, as necessary. \t In residual non-active foci, PACD may be used at key times (e.g. mid- and late transmission season) to screen the people most likely to have malaria (e.g. those with fever, migrant labourers and those who do not use prevention) in order to identify local cases indicative of ongoing transmission. RACD is then conducted to follow index cases. If indigenous cases are identified, the focus is reclassified as active (see  Fig. 12 ). \t In cleared foci, the programme should rely on the surveillance system to rapidly identify any malaria cases and to determine whether local transmission has resumed. Depending on the receptivity of the cleared focus, RACD can be conducted after identification of an index case. If new indigenous cases are identified, the focus is reclassified as active (see  Fig. 12 )."},{"nid":398,"text_data":"4.1 Surveillance of antimalarial drug efficacy and drug resistance  Information on the efficacy of recommended malaria treatment is critical for ensuring progress towards elimination and ensuring that patients receive efficacious treatment. WHO has prepared a standard protocol for therapeutic efficacy studies (TES) and tools for data analysis and monitoring    (26)   . TES are considered the gold standard for assessing antimalarial drug efficacy, and the resulting data are used to inform national malaria treatment policy in malaria endemic countries. TES are designed for monitoring the efficacy against both  P.   falciparum  and  P. vivax  of any of the recommended first- and second-line medicines as well as any medicine that is to be assessed before possible introduction into the treatment policy.  In areas in which there are very few malaria cases, it will be difficult to recruit enough patients to obtain interpretable information on drug efficacy. If these areas are pursuing malaria elimination, their surveillance systems will likely have been strengthened to improve case detection, increase case reporting from all sectors (private and public), ensure that all patients receive the full, supervised, recommended treatment (including radical cure) and confirm complete cure by following up patients at regular intervals    (5)   .

Patients attending hospitals may have more complex clinical presentations, be more likely to have had previous drug failure and be more difficult to follow up. Thus, whenever possible, monitoring should be done in or close to the community.  Sentinel sites should represent all the epidemiological strata in the country. Preferably, a site should have access to the required sample size. If this is not possible, the required sample size can be obtained by combining data from single-arm studies conducted in several sites in a geographical unit. Thus, what constitutes a sentinel site depends on the transmission setting. It may be:    a single health facility (health centre, hospital) or temporarily established facility in a community (typically in high-transmission settings); \t a group of health facilities (health centres, hospitals) in the same town or city (typically in high- or moderate-transmission settings); \t a group of health facilities (health centres, hospitals) in the same district (typically in low-to-moderate-transmission settings); \t a group of health facilities (health centres, hospitals) in several districts in the same province (typically in low-transmission settings); or \t cross-border health facilities (health centres, hospitals) in two neighbouring countries (rare).    Repeated TES at a few sites are adequate for collecting consistent longitudinal data, documenting trends and informing the national treatment policy.

To ensure the efficacy of the malaria treatment selected for national policy, WHO recommends a change in the national malaria treatment policy if the total treatment failure rate is \u2265 10% (as assessed by TES) and that the NMP adopts antimalarial medicines with a parasitological cure rate of &gt; 95%."},{"nid":404,"text_data":"4.3 Molecular markers of resistance to antimalarial drugs  Drug resistance is one of the causes of treatment failure, and characterization of the molecular markers of drug resistance is an important means of understanding resistance to antimalarial treatment.

A limited number of genes involved or potentially involved in the resistance of  P. falciparum  to antimalarial drugs have been identified:  Pfcrt  ( P. falciparum  chloroquine resistance transporter) conferring resistance to chloroquine,  Pfdhfr  ( P. falciparum  dihydrofolate reductase) conferring resistance to pyrimethamine and  Pfdhps  ( P.   falciparum  dihydropteroate synthase) conferring resistance to sulfadoxine.

In these areas, monitoring of drug efficacy can be integrated into the routine surveillance system by ensuring that the data collected on all malaria cases in the routine surveillance system can and are also being used to generate information about drug efficacy. For this purpose, the surveillance system is expected to have the capacity for:    good case detection; \t reporting on all cases of malaria, whether detected in the public or the private system; \t ensuring that all patients receive the full recommended treatment (including for radical cure) under supervision; and \t following up patients to confirm complete cure.    In TES, data are collected only on symptomatic cases (with fever or a history of fever). In integrated drug efficacy surveillance (iDES), data are collected on all cases, including asymptomatic cases and all species detected by PCD or ACD and subsequently reported to the surveillance system.  The role of the private sector and community services such as village health workers in detecting cases, providing treatment and following-up patients differs by country. In all countries, however, the NMP should be responsible for compiling and analysing data. A good diagnostic quality assurance system, covering all sectors involved in diagnosis, must be in place to generate reliable data. To ensure prompt, appropriate treatment of patients, and thereby elimination, the treatment policy must be up to date and both first- and second-line treatments must be available in all facilities providing diagnosis and treatment.  The activities and information required for integrated surveillance of drug efficacy are described below. They comprise:    patient classification and diagnosis, \t molecular analysis, \t treatment, \t patient follow-up, \t information on efficacy of first- and second-line treatments, \t classification of responses to treatment, \t data interpretation and policy considerations and \t budgeting for monitoring antimalarial efficacy    The procedures and the amount of data collated depend on the system in place and the resources available. The absolute minimum data that must be collected for analysing drug efficacy are data on all patients collected at least at twice: on the first day of treatment (day 0) and on the specified last day of follow-up. The data to be collected include characterization of the case, such as parasite species, the treatment provided, whether the patient was symptomatic, whether the case was detected by PCD or ACD, whether treatment was supervised and the treatment outcome. The case should also be classified as imported, introduced, indigenous, induced, relapsing or recrudescent. Further details on case characterization are given in    reference 5    (see also    section 3    and  Table 7 ).  The text below and Table 7 describe the mandatory and additional information recommended for collection in routine surveillance systems for analysis of drug efficacy. It is expected that the mandatory information will already have been collected in elimination settings with strong routine surveillance systems. When possible, the countries should collect all the information recommended below, as more data result in better information to guide policies.    Patient classification and diagnosis     As part of routine surveillance in elimination settings, a detailed case investigation and recording of probable origin are required in order to classify cases as imported, indigenous, induced, introduced, relapse or recrudescent. All suspected malaria cases are diagnosed (with species identification) by an RDT and\/or microscopy on day 0; microscopy is mandatory for detecting recurrent parasitaemia during follow-up and on the last day of follow-up. If resources allow, parasite detection on day 0 should include identification of species and stage (asexual and sexual) by microscopy.    Molecular analysis     Genotyping to distinguish between reinfection and recrudescence is not mandatory because the risk that treated individuals will experience recurrent parasitaemia due to a new infection is very low because of the small number of malaria cases in elimination settings. For this reason, all cases of recurrent parasitaemia will be considered by default true recrudescence (true treatment failure) if treatment is supervised. However, an additional blood sample can be collected on filter paper on day 0 and on the day of parasite recurrence. Blood samples can also be used to confirm species, assess known molecular markers of antimalarial drug resistance and facilitate identification of the geographical origin of parasites.    Treatment    All efforts must be made to supervise all treatment, including primaquine for patients with  P. vivax  infection. It must be recorded whether all doses of the treatment given were supervised.  P. vivax -infected patients should be tested for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) status. Patients with treatment failure (recurrence of parasitaemia with the same species during the follow-up period; for classification of failure (see  Table 5 ) should be given supervised second-line treatment and followed up again until cure is achieved. Hospitalization of patients during treatment is recommended if feasible.    Patient follow-up    All treated malaria patients should be followed up to the last day of the follow-up period appropriate for the species and the treatment administered. Specifically, the follow-up period for patients infected with  P. falciparum  is 28 days for drugs with a short half-life (artesunate + sulfadoxine\u2013pyrimethamine, artemether\u2013lumefantrine, artesunate\u2013 amodiaquine) and 42 days for drugs with a long half-life (artesunate\u2013 mefloquine, dihydroartemisinin\u2013piperaquine and artesunate\u2013 pyronaridine). The follow-up period for individuals infected with  P. vivax  is 28 days for asexual stages and 3 months for relapses. If human and financial resources allow, the follow-up period for cases of falciparum infection can be extended to 42 days after administration of a treatment with a short half-life or 56 days after treatment with a drug with a long half-life. In some settings,  P. vivax  patients should be followed up for 1 year.  At a minimum, all infected individuals should receive a clinical consultation and parasitological evaluation on day 0 and on the last day of follow-up (i.e. day 28, day 42 or the day of treatment failure). If fever or symptoms develop at any time during the follow-up period, the patients should undergo parasitological and clinical evaluation. Any consultations, including those that are unscheduled, should be documented. If an infected individual does not attend the mandatory consultation on the final day, intensive efforts must be made to locate him or her. If feasible, additional follow-up on day 3 and then weekly on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 for patients with  P. falciparum  infection is recommended. Similarly, weekly follow-up on days 7, 14, 21 and 28 and then monthly is recommended for patients with  P. vivax  (and  P. ovale  infection).    TABLE 7. Mandatory and recommended activities for integrated surveillance of drug efficacy             \u1d43 Due to regional differences in vivax relapses, the recommended minimum follow-up period is 8 months\u00a0for North-East Asia, South Asia and Central America, and 3 months for all other areas. The recommended\u00a0ideal follow-up period for all areas is 12 months. PCR, polymerase chain reaction; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.\u00a0   Information on efficacy of first- and second-line treatments     The objective of TES is to monitor the efficacy of first- and second-line treatments and, if required, that of any newly registered treatment for which information is necessary for a possible policy change. The main objective of integrated surveillance of drug efficacy, including supervision of treatment and patient follow-up, is to ensure patient cure and progress towards elimination. Information on drug efficacy is collected primarily for the first-line treatment given to patient as per the national treatment guidelines; a secondary objective is to inform treatment policy. Data on the efficacy of second-line treatment are collected only for patients with recrudescent infections after first-line treatment.    Classification of responses to treatment     As mentioned above, genotyping to distinguish between reinfection and recrudescence is not mandatory. When genotyping is not available, recurrent parasitaemia in all patients who received the mandatory supervised treatment is considered to be true recrudescence (true treatment failure). If information is available on genotype, the data should be PCR-corrected. If the treatment was not supervised, recurrent parasitaemia cannot be considered a true treatment failure, but it is important that all efforts are made to supervise subsequent treatment and register the outcome. When all the recommended data have been collected, each patient can be classified as per  Table 5  with the following limitations: The classification shown in  Table 5  can be used for infections with  P. falciparum  and for the first 28 days\u2019 follow-up for  P. vivax  only. Any recurrent  vivax  parasitaemia in the follow-up period after day 28 must be classified as a relapse. Early treatment failure can often not be classified in integrated surveillance, as the data will not be available. Furthermore, the category of early treatment failure cannot be used for patients with severe malaria diagnosed on day 0.    Data interpretation and policy considerations     Data must be analysed continually, especially for patients with treatment failure and for programmatic issues, including the number of patients lost to follow-up and whether second-line treatment was given to patients with treatment failure as per the national treatment policy. In addition to continual analysis, a fixed time should be set to review and discuss all data (e.g. an annual evaluation meeting), at which time data can be shared and discussed with WHO. The WHO malaria treatment guidelines    (17)    recommend that first-line treatment be changed if the total failure rate exceeds 10%; however, efficacy and failure rates should be considered in the context of their confidence intervals. Policy decisions can be informed by additional information, including on molecular markers, especially in very low transmission settings where there may be too few patients to obtain the desired level of precision (5%) and a confidence interval of 95%. In elimination settings, any treatment failure must be investigated, as this represents a potential source of onward spread of malaria."},{"nid":408,"text_data":"4.4.3 Budgeting for monitoring antimalarial efficacy  To ensure that a country conducting TES has sufficient resources, the following should be budgeted for: human resources, travel and transport, equipment and supplies, patient costs, technical assistance, supervision, a quality-assurance system, data management and laboratory support for genotyping. In addition, provision should be made for the necessary training, monitoring to improve the quality of clinical procedures and data collection, management, validation and reporting, which is usually provided by a consultant over 2\u20133 weeks. There must be strict adherence to the study protocol to ensure data quality.  When drug efficacy monitoring is fully integrated into surveillance activities, the funding, including for recommended activities such as analysis of molecular markers, should be part of the overall surveillance budget. Sufficient funding and human resources must be allocated to both the collection and analysis of data and supervision of the overall system."},{"nid":410,"text_data":"5.1 Rationale, definition and objectives  Globally, vector control has contributed significantly to reducing malaria morbidity and mortality    (28)    and accounts for the majority of the projected cost of implementing the  Global technical strategy for malaria 2016\u20132030  (29) .    Insecticide-based interventions, namely LLINs and IRS, are currently the core vector control interventions for malaria prevention. These interventions affect adult mosquito populations to reduce malaria transmission in various ways. Insecticides on nets or the interior surfaces of dwellings knock down, kill or repel vectors. As coverage of insecticidal interventions increases, mass killing of vector populations can result in protection even of those people in a community who are not directly covered by LLINs, in what is known as \u201ccommunity protection\u201d    (30,31)   . LLINs also provide personal protection against mosquito bites because of the physical barrier of the netting. These effects lead to a reduction in vector survival (longevity) and vector density, ultimately reducing the capacity of mosquitoes to transmit malaria parasites. Both LLINs and IRS are most effective where local vectors prefer to bite and rest indoors (i.e. are endophagic and endophilic); however, these interventions still provide an important level of control when local vectors primarily feed (exophagic)    (32)    and rest (exophilic) outdoors.  Targeting the aquatic immature stages of mosquitoes (eggs, larvae and pupae), referred to as larval source management (LSM), may also reduce malaria transmission by affecting the density of adult vectors. This is considered supplementary to the core interventions outlined above. LSM consists of the permanent removal or temporary disruption of standing water to eliminate or reduce mosquito egg-laying and immature stages or of regular application of biological or chemical insecticides to water bodies to kill or disrupt the development of immature stages. These methods may be effective (singly or in combination) in settings where there are few, fixed and findable aquatic habitats of malaria vectors.  Indicators of programme progress in vector control coverage, access and use are of critical importance (see    section 5.6    and  Table 14 ). The quality of vector control products must be monitored to ensure that they adhere to specifications and perform effectively and safely throughout their life. Monitoring the performance of vector control interventions includes assessing the durability of LLIN products in the field and the residual efficacy of IRS formulations after application to walls and ceilings.  Core and supplementary interventions may exert selection pressure that affects the frequency, intensity or mechanisms of insecticide resistance. Variations in the impact of interventions on individual mosquito species as a result of differences in susceptibility to insecticides or propensity to contact interventions can result in more efficient killing of certain species and alter species composition. Thus, the overall effectiveness of interventions against the remaining vectors may change over time, necessitating alternative or supplementary interventions. Systematic tracking of vector species and their characteristics and monitoring of interventions to identify any modifications that might be required in vector control strategies are therefore essential.  Entomological surveillance can be defined as the regular, systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of entomological data for risk assessment, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of vector control interventions. All surveillance activities must be clearly linked to programme decisions to ensure optimal vector control. In malaria intervention programmes, the main objectives of entomological surveillance are to:      Characterize receptivity to guide stratification and selection of interventions.  Potential malaria transmission within a country often differs significantly, as indicated by the heterogeneity in receptivity (see    section 5.5     ) . The entomological parameters considered in risk characterization include the vector species present and the characteristics that influence transmission.\u00b9\u00a0Important traits such as biting (time, place and host preference), dispersion and resting behaviour should be known for all the principal vectors, as these traits determine receptivity and thus guide the selection of interventions. Characterization of receptivity can be used to target vector control in order to ensure appropriate coverage of at-risk populations     (33)   . Better targeting of interventions contributes to optimized use of resources and may ultimately increase impact. \t   Track the relative density of malaria vector species (and their bionomics\u00b2) to determine the seasonality of transmission and the optimal timing of interventions . The composition of vector species should be tracked over time; up-to-date information is important, as the relative density of species can change with seasonal and other environmental changes and with effective interventions. \t   Track insecticide resistance as a basis for choosing insecticides.  Vectors have developed physiological resistance to the insecticides used in interventions (mainly LLINs and IRS), which must be monitored closely. The frequency, intensity and mechanisms of resistance should be assessed in the principal malaria vectors and, when possible, in secondary vectors. Information on insecticide resistance should be used in choosing insecticides, in line with insecticide resistance management plans. This is of increasing importance as new vector control tools, including new insecticides, become available. \t   Identify other threats to the effectiveness of vector control.  The composition and behaviour of vector populations may change and thus undermine the effectiveness of interventions. For instance, the relative proportion of outdoor transmission may increase as a result of effective control of endophagic and\/or endophilic vectors. Vectors should therefore be tracked to detect any significant change in the location in which transmission takes place, in order to decide whether supplementary interventions are required, such as new tools to control outdoor transmission. \t   Monitor vector control intervention coverage and quality to identify gaps and opportunities.  The intervention(s) used should also be monitored to ensure optimal implementation and to indicate any corrections required. Monitoring of interventions includes assessing coverage, access, use and their acceptability and quality, such as the physical or fabric integrity and insecticidal activity of LLINs and the residual efficacy of IRS.    Entomological surveillance activities required to achieve these objectives may include:    identifying the malaria vector species; \t measuring species-specific vector densities and ascertaining vector composition; \t determining vector blood-feeding habits (zoophilic, anthropophilic); \t assessing other vector behaviour (exophily, endophily, exophagy, endophagy); \t monitoring vector susceptibility to insecticides (frequency, intensity and mechanisms of resistance); \t measuring the rates of infection of the vector with the malaria parasite (sporozoite rate, oocyst rate); and \t identifying the aquatic habitats of immature stages of vectors and habitat characteristics.    The monitoring and evaluation activities required to achieve the above objectives may involve:    \u00a0measuring the coverage, access, use and acceptance of interventions (see    section 7   ); \t \u00a0measuring the durability of LLINs in the field; \t \u00a0measuring the residual efficacy of insecticides; and \t \u00a0observing application of larviciding.    These indicators should be measured over time in order to identify any appreciable and informative trends. \u00a0 \u00b9\u00a0Importation of vectors from other areas (including those that fly or are passively transported by aircraft,ships or other means) may be another component of vulnerability, but this is a minor consideration in most settings as it is relatively rare.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0  \u00b2 Vector bionomics is the study of the mode of life of organisms in their natural habitat and their adaptation to their surroundings. Basic studies are those on the development of immature stages and the influence of environmental conditions on the life of adults."},{"nid":411,"text_data":"5.2 Surveillance systems for entomology and vector control  Entomological surveillance should be conducted to inform vector control planning and implementation to ensure that appropriate interventions are being used where they are needed; it should be directed by the NMP. The surveillance approach used in a country will depend on its past and present malaria epidemiology. The surveillance strategy should therefore be appraised periodically and revised if necessary to ensure cost\u2013effective use of resources for vector control, particularly when significant changes in caseloads are being observed through reporting or surveys. Collaborations with other vector control programmes, research institutions, central or regional reference laboratories and other partners should be drawn upon for technical and programme support, as appropriate.  Surveillance can be categorized as preliminary or baseline surveys, routine sentinel surveys for observation of trends, spot checks for supplementary data collection and focus investigations during elimination or in response to outbreaks ( Box 8 ).    BOX 8. Types of surveys for vector control       Preliminary or baseline surveys:  These initial, time-limited surveys are used to gather baseline data for planning vector control measures. They provide information on the vector species present, their resting and feeding habits, changes in species composition by season and over time, types of water bodies used as larval habitats and vector susceptibility to insecticides. Information on local vector species and their ecology, biology and behaviour will often have been assembled and used to inform current control or elimination strategies. Data from these types of surveys can also be used to identify appropriate sentinel surveillance sites.    Routine sentinel surveys:  Long-term observations are made regularly, such as monthly, quarterly or annually, in fixed locations. Their purpose is to identify any change in vector species density and composition, behaviour, susceptibility to insecticides and even infection rates, which may explain any observed epidemiological trends in malaria transmission, and ultimately to indicate the appropriate response. All malaria-endemic countries should have established entomological surveillance sites that have been carefully selected on the basis of multiple criteria (see next page). As transmission decreases and malaria becomes more focal, the location of sentinel sites should be adjusted to ensure collection of data that are applicable to the remaining transmission foci.    Spot checks:  Ad-hoc assessments are carried out in selected locations as a supplement to routine observations and when more information is required to inform programme adjustment or response. Spot checks may include investigations in areas where there are suspected problems in the quality of implementation of an intervention; an expected increase in receptivity and\/or vulnerability, perhaps due to reintroduction or proliferation of a vector species as a result of environmental changes; the presence of vulnerable populations due, e.g. to resettlement, migration or mining; and heightened risks for importation due to increased human movement in border areas or transport routes linked to endemic countries.    Focus investigations:  These investigations are undertaken in areas of new, persistent or resurgent malaria transmission to determine why the interventions being used are no longer reducing transmission. They are short-term, reactive epidemiological investigations in settings of elimination or prevention of re-establishment. The trigger for a focus investigation could be an increase in the prevalence of parasite infections or clinical malaria cases.  Routine entomological surveillance is distinct from the more detailed evaluations of entomology and vector control in operational research, which is usually conducted by partner institutes, including national research or academic institutions, to answer specific research questions, rather than as routine monitoring. Operational research is not discussed in this manual.    General criteria for selecting surveillance sites    Sites for conducting routine entomological sentinel surveys should ideally represent the range of eco-epidemiological settings in a country, including ecological zones with different malaria vector species and epidemiological regions or zones with different levels of malaria transmission (see    section 7.4   )    (33,34)   . It is essential that data generated at entomological sentinel sites can be linked to information on local malaria epidemiology (see    section 3.5 ,  section 3.6   and    3.7   ), such as at a health facility that serves as a sentinel site. Sentinel surveillance should be conducted iteratively, and the location of sites might have to be changed on the basis of epidemiological and entomological data. In areas where transmission has ceased because of effective control, sentinel surveillance should be used to re-assess the receptivity of the area. Depending on the outcome, surveillance sites should be maintained in areas in which transmission has been interrupted but where significant risk remains or should be (re-)moved from areas with no or low malariogenic potential.  The other main characteristics to be considered in selecting entomological sentinel sites are the:    \u00a0vector control interventions being used or planned, to ensure selection of sites that are\u00a0representative, such as use of LLINs only, IRS only, LLINs and IRS, LLINs and larviciding; \t \u00a0past or current use of insecticides in agriculture, which can affect the susceptibility of\u00a0vectors to the insecticides used in malaria vector control; \t \u00a0previous transmission levels, including hot spots with a history of epidemics; \t \u00a0locations or areas at high risk of importation of cases, infected vectors or invasive vector\u00a0species, such as ports, border posts or resting stops along major transport routes; \t \u00a0ongoing or planned development that might change receptivity or vulnerability, such as\u00a0increases in human or vector populations (e.g. at dam sites); \t \u00a0location and availability of human resources and infrastructure, including trained personnel (entomologists, vector control technicians and mosquito collectors), facilities (insectaries, laboratories) and equipment (microscopes, test kits); \t location and availability of health facilities or partner institutes to house equipment and provide human resources for surveys; and \t anticipated accessibility of sites during the planned times of surveys, such as periods of high rainfall.    The number of sentinel sites required strongly depends on the size and ecological and epidemiological diversity of a country. It is proposed, as an approximate guide for monitoring resistance to insecticides, that there should be at least one sentinel site for every 500 000 nets distributed or 200 000 houses sprayed    (35\u201337)   . This is equivalent to about one site per 1 million people protected, although the exact number will depend on the country\u2019s epidemiology and population density. The distribution and number of sites should be reviewed periodically and adapted according to epidemiological data, identified patterns of resistance and available human and financial resources."},{"nid":413,"text_data":"5.4 Frequency of surveys  The frequency of vector sampling for measuring indicators depends on the question being posed and the available resources. The length of the transmission season and other environmental conditions that influence entomological parameters and malaria transmission should be considered. The frequency and timing of sampling should be standardized to minimize sampling bias when tracking temporal trends. Sampling is usually best undertaken during times of peak vector density and\/or malaria parasite transmission. Further information on frequency by transmission setting is provided below."},{"nid":414,"text_data":"2.7.1 Systems, functions and coordination  Structures for disease surveillance differ by country and by programme goals. In some countries, data functions are undertaken by an integrated HMIS unit rather than by separate programmes. This arrangement can ensure good coordination in system design and reduce duplication in requests for data. Malaria programme managers must liaise closely with health information staff to ensure prompt access to relevant data. In other countries, most data management is undertaken by programme staff. In these cases, coordination with information units is necessary to ensure use of common datasets, such as population projections, health facility lists and coding systems. Opportunities should be created for consolidating analysis of information with other programmes, so that progress in malaria control can be put into perspective.  In order to coordinate system developments across programmes, a \u201chealth information system development committee\u201d might be established, with representatives from a variety of health programmes and senior management. The committee could ensure that the information system prepared by the ministry of health is coherent, rather than one that is incompatible, unnecessary or unsustainable.  Table 2  lists the various components of HMIS and general issues related to each component.    TABLE 2.     Components of HMIS relevant to malaria surveillance           Fig. 5  illustrates the typical data and information flow in an HMIS and linkages with national programme databases used for decision-making.  The steps in strengthening HMIS, in most situations building on existing systems    (10)   , are as follows.    \u00a0Review the existing system. \t \u00a0Define the data needs of relevant units in the health system, such as the community, health\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0system, intermediate and central levels. \t \u00a0Determine the most appropriate, effective data flow. \t \u00a0Design the data collection and reporting tools. \t \u00a0Develop the procedures and mechanisms for data processing. \t \u00a0Develop and implement a training programme for data providers and data users. \t \u00a0Pilot test and, if necessary, redesign the system for optimal data collection, data flow, data\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0processing and data use. \t \u00a0Monitor and evaluate the system. \t \u00a0Prepare effective data dissemination and feedback mechanisms. \t \u00a0Continuously strengthen the HMIS.      FIG. 5. Data flow and analysis, from national HMIS to NMP decision-making         Establishing a surveillance system for elimination takes more time, as it often requires updating legislation and policies, establishing new system components (for case and focus investigations, active case detection (ACD) and laboratory quality control), training and recruiting staff and educating the public. Lessons learnt from the establishment of surveillance systems in various epidemiological settings should be used to prepare gradually for active elimination nationwide. The preparatory activities should be supported by changes to legislation to ensure that malaria is a mandatory notifiable disease and all health sectors, including the private sector, are required to use similar case definitions and participate in all aspects of surveillance.  Because of more intense activities, surveillance systems for elimination require additional staffing, sometimes with new or revised responsibilities.    Staff at national level are responsible for policy-making and decision-making, coordination, supervision, monitoring and evaluation of programme management and progress. The staff should preferably include clinicians, epidemiologists, parasitologists, entomologists, laboratory experts, communication experts and information technology specialists (including data managers and geographic information systems technicians). The national reference laboratory will provide support to the ministry of health in establishing quality assurance systems for diagnostic testing. \t At intermediate levels (provinces, regions and districts), depending on the public health structure and the size of the country, epidemiologists, parasitologists, entomologists and data managers may be required, particularly in areas with active foci and repeated imported cases. These staff members are responsible for all aspects of malaria surveillance, including data collection and analysis, monitoring and early recognition of outbreaks or changes in disease trends. They may also lead a well-trained case and focus investigation team. \t At health facilities, case investigations may require trained staff who can rapidly and effectively investigate new cases of malaria to classify them appropriately.

The not-for-profit sector is often run by faith-based or public\u2013 private initiatives, which in many countries may also be registered as public health facilities. Surveillance for malaria by the private sector should, in principle, be identical to that in the public sector, with similar forms and reporting of the same core data elements at the same frequency  (Table 1) . In many malaria-endemic countries, however, the private sector is less well regulated than the public sector and has limited capacity for accurate diagnosis and reporting; some may not recognize the value of reporting data    (11)   . Thus, surveillance in the private sector is often inconsistent, with limited reporting to the national health information system. Nevertheless, in sub-Saharan African countries, nearly 40% of patients seek treatment in the private sector, and in some countries outside Africa this figure is over 50%    (12)   ; the proportion is often higher in urban areas, and remote rural areas are often served by an informal private sector.  National dialogue, coordination, incentives, regulation and accreditation should be used to encourage the private sector to report to the surveillance system. Improved public health sector service delivery and better access are also likely to reduce reliance on the private sector, thereby increasing the proportion of cases identified in the public sector.  In settings in which the goal is to reduce the burden of malaria, data from passive case detection (PCD) in the private sector may be aggregated, whereas in elimination settings they should be case-based. Nevertheless, case-based reporting should be encouraged in areas for burden reduction if the electronic system is advanced enough to include case details without adding to the health worker workload.  The private sector has no mandate for case investigation but should be required by law not only to treat patients according to national guidelines and notify each case but also to refer all cases (before or after treatment) to the public sector for further investigation and classification. The increasing availability and flexibility of mobile and Internet technology will improve surveillance in the private sector    (13)   .  The following general guidelines should help countries to improve malaria surveillance in the private sector.    \u00a0Map private health sector providers by type (formal or informal), location (urban or rural), regulation (registered or unregistered), level\u00a0 of reporting and connectivity to a mobile and\/or Internet network and other relevant characteristics. \t \u00a0Set up a database (preferably geocoded) of private health care providers who manage malaria cases. \t \u00a0Explore approaches to strengthening regulation. In high-burden settings, legal provisions should require that entities involved in malaria diagnosis and treatment are registered with the relevant authorities and that their licences are renewed regularly. In eliminations settings, health legislation should ensure that all health care providers report confirmed mal aria cases as part of notifiable disease surveillance. \t \u00a0Conduct studies to determine the appropriate approaches and incentives to improving malaria case management and surveillance in the private sector in the national context. \t \u00a0Foster close, routine interaction among the ministry of health, NMPs and the private health sector by disseminating information, regular visits, supportive supervision and training. \t \u00a0Provide the private sector with simple, inexpensive reporting materials and systems, including mobile and Internet applications. In some contexts, minimal financial incentives or free\/subsidized antimalarials and diagnostics may help with improved private sector surveillance. \t \u00a0Ensure consistent feedback to facilities in the private sector that report data to the national system. \t \u00a0Help the private sector to obtain subsidized or free diagnostics and case management commodities."},{"nid":416,"text_data":"2.7.3 Surveillance by community health workers  CHWs extend public health services to hard-to-reach areas or underserved populations to expand diagnosis and treatment. Often, these workers are designated to a health facility, the staff of which oversee their activities and provide health commodities and to which the CHWs report cases and use of commodities. In areas with relatively high caseloads, CHWs may report aggregated data monthly. In elimination settings, they should be capable of immediate diagnosis, treatment and case notification and, when possible, participate in ACD, case and focus investigations.  The minimum data collected during community surveillance are the same as those collected at health posts (   Annex 6   ). The records of such services should be reported and analysed separately from national data; otherwise, national trends will be skewed by additional cases seen by CHWs. Cases detected passively through the routine system should be reported separately from those detected actively in the community (see    section 3.2   ). In settings in which CHWs are well established and the data they report are unlikely to change trends, there is no harm in aggregating the data into health facility reports. Mobile health applications have made it possible to establish efficient surveillance systems involving CHWs and volunteers    (14) ."},{"nid":417,"text_data":"2.7.4 Surveillance of high-risk groups, including migrant and mobile populations  Populations who are at higher risk for malaria than the general population may be present in all settings. Migrant and mobile populations, including those in specific occupations (e.g. forest workers, road constructors), livelihoods (e.g. nomadic pastoralists), illegal and\/or undocumented immigrants, refugees and internally displaced persons and tourists    (15)   , may be at higher risk for malaria infection and disease    (16)    and may serve as residual reservoirs of infection, contributing to sustaining or the re-emergence of transmission. The characteristics of these populations that expose them to higher risks include their mobility, occupations that result in frequent contact with the vector, poor access to health prevention and treatment, poverty, displacement and cultural factors that result in marginalization. Mobile populations near international borders could import malaria infection from endemic to non-endemic but receptive areas. Conversely, populations moving or migrating from malaria-free areas to endemic areas could be at high risk of disease because of lack of immunity.  These high-risk populations tend to organize themselves, and identification of such organizing systems will indicate the best way to improve access and surveillance. As some migrant and mobile populations may wish to remain undetected for legal reasons, a trustworthy, safe environment should be created to ensure access to interventions and surveillance.  The surveillance strategies used in such situations should maximize case detection and response, and the main goal should be improved access to health services.  Fig. 7  illustrates a stepwise approach to documenting high-risk populations, conducting surveillance and responding. Mapping of migration routes is important for designing appropriate surveillance of mobile populations and updating information on those at highest risk, as the risk factors and populations may change over time.

In these areas, routine entomological surveillance can be conducted at sentinel sites monthly, quarterly or during peak transmission seasons, augmented by spot checks in areas with specific problems (as described in   section 5.2   ). For instance, if high-intensity insecticide resistance is confirmed at one sentinel site, additional spot checks can be conducted in neighbouring areas to determine the extent of resistance. Similarly, if changes in vector species composition and\/or behaviour are observed at a sentinel site, it may be useful to conduct spot checks in places where similar changes could be expected.    TABLE 9.     Routine entomological surveillance by priority in different malaria transmission settings, relevance, and appropriate vector sampling methods and analytical techniques          \u00a0  a. Preferable to test adults reared from collected immature mosquitoes; if necessary, adult progeny from collected adult females can be tested.  b. Depending on method, should test individuals confirmed as resistant in bioassays (E,F).  c. High priority if vector control is to be targeted on the basis of resistance profiles, such as the addition of IRS to LLINs or use of pyrethroid plus piperonyl butoxide nets.  d. High priority only if LSM is applied or is being considered as a supplementary intervention (i.e. where there are few, fixed and easily accessible larval habitats).  e. High priority if an invasive species is being investigated in response to a resurgence of malaria or vector composition has changed, with a secondary vector species suspected of being of increased importance in transmission.  f. Useful for stratification.  g. Proportion of adult emergence from pupae should also be measured where insect growth regulators are used or being considered for use.  h. For larvae, the usual measures are resistance level (i.e. concentration required to kill 50% or 95% of test mosquitoes, LD50 and LD95) and resistance ratio (i.e. LD50 for test population \/ LD50 for susceptible strain).  In low-transmission areas, surveillance should be conducted at sentinel sites during the peak transmission season. Spot checks can be conducted in areas with persistent malaria, and consideration given to establishing sentinel sites in those areas. As the vector density may be low, it may be difficult to collect sufficient numbers of mosquitoes to test for multiple indicators, and careful prioritization will be required. Measures of human blood index, sporozoite rates and entomological inoculation rates are unreliable when there are few specimens, and they are less likely to be informative and actionable in such settings. Therefore, in these areas, vector species composition and the frequency and status of insecticide resistance are the highest priorities, as is assessment of relative receptivity.  The selection of surveillance sites becomes increasingly important as transmission decreases, as the key entomological parameters will become more heterogeneous. Surveillance should therefore be targeted on the basis of epidemiological data and local knowledge of malaria risk. Areas in which transmission patterns are changing (e.g. greater vulnerability due to a humanitarian crisis that has displaced human populations) must be identified, and entomological spot checks conducted to assess receptivity and to implement vector control accordingly."},{"nid":420,"text_data":"5.5.2 Priorities for entomological surveillance by transmission setting \u2013 Very low transmission and elimination  Routine entomological surveillance must be maintained in settings of very low transmission and elimination. Priority should be given to collecting information related to measuring receptivity, to determine where interventions may be required and to determine whether surveillance should be changed, such as relocating sentinel sites to ensure that they are in the optimal position to obtain the necessary information. Sentinel sites should be located where there is ongoing and\/or a significant risk of transmission, which requires periodic appraisal of information and realignment of the surveillance strategy. Surveillance might have to be intensified in the event of new, resurgent and persistent transmission, by adding sites, more frequent surveillance or measurement of additional indicators. Spot checks will be required when routine surveillance does not provide adequate information or to obtain additional data on a specific situation or risk.  As transmission decreases over large areas with effective control, it will become more focalized, and, close to elimination, transmission will be limited to small foci. In these settings, in addition to routine entomological surveillance and spot checks, focus investigations that include entomological activities might be required (see    section 5.5   ). The main purpose of such investigations is to clarify the nature of transmission in the focus to guide the appropriate response to interrupt malaria transmission, such as modification of vector control to enhance its effectiveness.  Additional entomological investigations are justified where there is a possibility of local transmission (i.e. indigenous or introduced cases) in foci where transmission had been interrupted, or in foci where transmission has been reduced to a very low level but there is an upsurge and insufficient entomological data have been collected by routine surveillance or spot checks within the previous 3 years.  In areas in which transmission has been interrupted, transmission foci may re-emerge due to factors related to vectors and\/or interventions, including: lapses in vector control, such as low coverage or poor quality of implementation; changes in vector populations that render interventions less effective (e.g. avoidance behaviour, insecticide resistance); increased receptivity (e.g. increased vector density or survival due to environmental changes); or introduction of infectious vectors or invasive species that are efficient vectors. Focus investigations are required to determine which of these potential factors is the cause of resurgence of transmission and, once identified, to design an appropriate response to re-interrupt transmission.  The indicators to be measured in an entomological investigation in a transmission focus depend on local factors such as knowledge of local vector species and the availability, use and quality of interventions. Initial surveys should focus on the current vector control situation and include interviews with local residents to assess the coverage of interventions (i.e. access to and use of vector control measures). If LLINs are used, assessment of coverage should include the time since distribution. If IRS was performed, the assessment should take into account the time since houses in the area were last sprayed. If coverage of vector control interventions is low or has decreased significantly, population access to LLINs should be improved or IRS should be reintroduced. If effective coverage is readily restored, no further investigations may be required; however, if vector control coverage is found to be adequate, survey teams should assess whether human behaviour, such as late-night activities or sleeping away from the house, contribute to the risk of local transmission. If the population has activities that result in an increased risk of malaria, they should be informed about the risk and, when possible, given recommendations or interventions to reduce the risk.    BOX 9.    Countries undertaking elimination may consider using a tiered approach in focus investigations. The first step is to assess whether the cases are indigenous, introduced or imported. If they are indigenous or introduced, the next step is to determine whether the population at risk has access to and is using recommended, highquality vector control interventions. If not, the immediate response should be to strengthen or re-deploy a core intervention (LLINs or IRS) and\/or provide heath messages to increase community compliance. When the cases are indigenous or introduced and intervention coverage is high and\/or there is limited entomological information, an entomological investigation should be conducted to determine the vector species involved, its susceptibility to the insecticides used for vector control and the relevant vector bionomics. If the malaria cases are imported, induced or relapsing, the only consideration is adequate coverage and the quality of vector control in the focus to prevent onward transmission    (see section 3.3)   .  If vector control coverage, use and quality are high and there are no latenight or other activities that might increase the risk of malaria transmission, entomological investigations should be conducted to verify the presence of vector species according to data on previous malaria transmission. For instance, if an active focus is located in a district or province for which there are no entomological data, an entomological investigation might be required to verify the vector species present (and its relative density, if possible). If a new vector species is identified, it may be necessary to determine its behaviour and the frequency and status of resistance to insecticides. Resistance should also be determined when high-intensity resistance is suspected or if there are multiple vector control options, such as different IRS formulations or pyrethroid plus piperonyl butoxide nets. In areas with vectors that are expected to be exophilic or exophagic, assessment of vector behaviour may be justified. Where LSM is used or being considered as a supplementary intervention, a detailed map of larval habitats will be a prerequisite for effective deployment of this intervention.  A more comprehensive entomological investigation may be warranted if there is an increase in either species of Plasmodium parasite, such as if a new case due to  P. falciparum  is found in a focus in an area where  P. vivax  was thought to be the only endemic malaria parasite species. While data are required to inform an appropriate response, immediate programme action should not be delayed while waiting for the results of an entomological investigation. When possible, activities should be conducted in parallel to ensure the most efficient response. Further adjustments can be made to interventions as additional information becomes available.

Plans and practical approaches for preventing the introduction or re-establishment of malaria should be developed on the basis of assessment of those risks, which are the combined effect of receptivity and vulnerability (see    section 7.4   ).  Past entomological data can be a good baseline of information; priority should be given to determining the occurrence of vector species, with past data used to infer vector behaviour. Routine entomological surveillance and\/or spot checks should be used in areas of high receptivity and\/or high vulnerability, i.e. where the risk of re-establishment is significant. Areas in which there are anticipated increases in risk due to human activities should be included, such as those in which there are current or anticipated changes in population movement, land use,\u00b3\u00a0environment and weather conditions, such as those that increase the availability of suitable habitats for malaria vectors, contact between humans and vectors or importation of vectors.  In the event of locally acquired cases and insufficient entomological data, spot checks will be required, as outlined above (   section 5.2   ).    Threat of invasive species    Vigilant monitoring should be conducted in areas that are prone to or at high risk of invasive vector species,\u2074 as malariogenic potential can increase as a result of the introduction of species with high vectorial capacity. Better surveillance tools are required for early detection of invasive vector species to ensure rapid response and containment before these species become established in local environments and\/or spread over wide areas. Priority locations include those at high risk of vector entry, such as major ports, railway stations and rest stops along transport routes to endemic countries.  If invasive vectors have been introduced, early detection of areas in which they are present is critical for rapid introduction of mitigation measures and local elimination of the species. Aggressive vector control, such as focal IRS and LSM to target adults and larval stages, will be required. In the early phase of mosquito colonization, when it is thought that invasive mosquitoes are still limited to small foci (generally considered to be around 1 km2 ), countries should conduct entomological investigations in and around the colonized areas to guide and evaluate interventions to eliminate the invasive mosquitoes.  Where invasive mosquitoes have become established and can no longer be eliminated, the emphasis should be on prevention of disease outbreaks and further spread of the vectors. As there is only limited experience with the elimination of invasive mosquitoes, countries should carefully evaluate and document the activities undertaken and their impact, for the benefit of improving guidance in this area.  \u00b3\u00a0Examples of land use change include deforestation and cultivation of natural swamps in the African\u00a0highlands that resulted in conditions favourable to the survival of  An. gambiae , deforestation in South\u00a0America that led to increased populations of  An. darling  and  An. aquasalis  and reforestation in India and\u00a0Southeast Asia that resulted in increases in the numbers of malaria cases due to  An. fluviatilis  and\u00a0 An. dirus .\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0  \u2074 For example,  An. stephensi  was recorded for the first time in Sri Lanka in 2017, posing a potential\u00a0challenge to the prevention of re-establishment of malaria in the country."},{"nid":423,"text_data":"5.6.1 Implementation  Correct deployment of vector control interventions is necessary to ensure adequate coverage of the targeted populations.

Countries that have no data on the LLIN or IRS products used or have some evidence of the poor performance of certain products should make post-marketing surveillance a priority.  Programmes for the distribution of LLINs should periodically monitor their durability to ascertain their \u201csurvivorship\u201d or attrition, physical and fabric integrity and insecticidal activity (bio-efficacy) during their expected use (usually 3 years). This is best done in a prospective study within a mass distribution campaign    (54)   .

The quality of IRS spraying is monitored in standard WHO cone assays conducted immediately after spraying and thereafter once a month during the expected duration of residual efficacy of the insecticide formulation. Any concern about poor quality should be relayed to the operational teams immediately. Remedial measures will depend on the findings of investigations of spraying quality; they may include closer supervision of spray teams, retraining of spray operators, verifying the quality of the IRS products used or respraying houses in the target area.  Where LSM is used, its impact should be determined by monitoring changes in vector density before and after implementation.

The normal pattern is defined on the basis of a threshold computed from past data (see    section 6.5.4   ). \u201cNormal\u201d occurrence can, however, be defined only for a particular population in a specific area and time. Therefore, malaria epidemics are generally considered to be disturbances of a previous epidemiological equilibrium    (59)   . Epidemics in nonimmune populations often result in higher rates of morbidity and case fatality in all age groups than those in strongly seasonal transmission. An epidemic can also be a situation in which the malaria caseload exceeds the capacity of health care facilities to handle them in areas with a stable population and stable health service provision. In countries and territories that experience a sharp decrease in malaria incidence after intensive malaria control, the \u201cnormal\u201d conditions from which epidemics are assessed also change and evolve with time  (Fig. 14) .  A malaria outbreak is often synonymous with a malaria epidemic; however, conventionally, outbreaks are epidemics with small caseloads (and, to avoid confusion, the term \u201cepidemic\u201d is used throughout this document) or a sudden occurrence of malaria in areas that had never experienced the disease before or had eliminated it and are limited geographically. While large epidemics are generally easy to define, small epidemics may be difficult to distinguish from expected seasonal and periodic variations.  Countries in which there are areas prone to epidemics or that are in transition from burden reduction to elimination should have an epidemic preparedness plan that is an integral part of a comprehensive national strategic plan. The plan should clearly define the roles and responsibilities of different actors and describe the processes of forecasting, early warning and early detection, with specific expected actions at each stage and appropriate response activities.

Classification of epidemics and geographical areas in which epidemics most frequently occur         Complex emergencies may lead to epidemics when transmission is exacerbated by natural disasters and breakdown of services and population movement.

Epidemics occur when the equilibrium between the rate of infection and the immunity of a population in a given area is disturbed or where prevention and treatment services are interrupted. Malaria epidemics do not usually occur in hightransmission areas because the population has partial immunity; however, migration of nonimmune people to these areas or breakdown of services leading to an increase in infection and severe disease in vulnerable subgroups may result in epidemics in high-transmission areas.  In summary, the following conditions make populations vulnerable to malaria epidemics:    breakdown of prevention and treatment services, especially in highly receptive areas; \t migration of nonimmune people to areas with high malaria transmission;\u00a0 \t introduction of parasites and\/or suitable vectors to receptive areas where transmission is low or inexistent and where the population therefore does not have a high degree of immunity; \t increased population vulnerability after a long period of drought (and famine) with no malaria transmission, followed by intensive rainfall and creation of suitable environmental conditions for epidemics; and \t resistance of the vectors and parasites to insecticides and drugs, respectively.    These conditions may be a consequence of both human-made and natural factors  (Fig. 16) .    FIG. 16.

See    section 7.4    for more details on stratification.  The following are common characteristics of areas prone to malaria epidemics.    The ecology of the area supports low, highly seasonal transmission, and the population has limited immunity. Anomalous climatic or epidemiological conditions could result in greatly increased transmission. Such areas include highlands and arid and semi-arid areas. \t The rate of parasite infection has been reduced by interventions, but receptivity remains high.

Epidemic thresholds that are appropriate to the epidemiological context of the area should determine their occurrence.  In epidemic-prone areas, where immunity is low, all age groups are at risk. If the majority of people attending most health facilities with fever and who are confirmed as having malaria are under 5 years of age or are pregnant, the region is probably endemic.  The most important data elements for monitoring epidemics are:  at all levels,    \u00a0weekly number of cases tested (RDT or microscopy), \t \u00a0weekly number of cases positive (RDT or microscopy) and \t \u00a0weekly test positivity rate; and,    in higher-level health facilities,    \u00a0weekly number of inpatient malaria cases (admissions) and \t \u00a0weekly number of malaria deaths    Malaria epidemics escalate rapidly, with an average duration of 3\u20134 months. Monthly reporting cannot capture an upsurge of malaria cases at an early stage; therefore, the programme will be unable to deploy control resources quickly enough. As such, weekly reports on the above data elements are required to detect and control epidemics within 2 weeks of onset.  In elimination settings with high-quality case-based surveillance and rapid notification systems, epidemics are easier to detect early. The main requirement is that the right analytical system be in place to compare cases with the epidemic threshold and to send immediate alerts.  In most moderate-to-high-transmission countries with pockets of epidemic-prone areas, however, the HMIS often reports monthly aggregated data, which are not useful for early detection of an epidemic. In this situation, a more useful source might be data on both malaria and other febrile notifiable diseases like meningitis, cholera and yellow fever, which are reported weekly through the integrated diseases surveillance and response system. Other reporting of events, through the media, in the community or even rumours, may be used in the early detection of epidemics."},{"nid":438,"text_data":"6.5.4 Epidemic threshold detection system  The epidemic threshold is the critical level at which the reported counts of cases or deaths in a given space and time are higher than would be considered \u201cnormal\u201d. This threshold is used to confirm the presence of an epidemic so as to accelerate appropriate control or response measures. The computation of an effective threshold requires the following:    weekly data on confirmed malaria cases. Caution must be exercised where increased cases\u00a0is\u00a0partly or wholly due to improved confirmation rates or access to health services; \t in epidemic-prone settings, the threshold that is specific to a given area or administrative unit, as malaria is highly focal (a national threshold should not be applied subnationally); \t at least 5 years of weekly data to define the expected \u201clong-term\u201d weekly caseload; \t as transmission decreases sharply due to recent interventions, removal of past data, which\u00a0could bias trends; \t calculation of two thresholds: an alert threshold for early warning (less sensitive) and an\u00a0 \u00a0epidemic threshold for early detection (highly sensitive); and \t exclusion of the year of interest from calculation of a threshold.    Several approaches, which are often complex, can be used to calculate thresholds. For operational purposes, the following relatively simple methods are recommended:    constant case count, \t mean \u00b1 2 SD, \t medium + upper third quartile and \t cumulative sum method    Where there are few data to estimate thresholds, an epidemic may be suspected from a noticeable, rapid increase in weekly numbers, a high case fatality ratio (due to late appropriate treatment at community level), overwhelming of health services (e.g. shortage of health staff and drugs) or closure of nearby health facilities. See  Table 11  and subsequent worked examples for details of the methods for computing epidemic thresholds.  Table 12  gives an example of weekly malaria data from 2011\u20132016 and  Fig. 20  shows the data plotted by the various methods for computing thresholds to assess whether an epidemic of malaria occurred in 2016.

Epidemic thresholds for 2011\u20132015 as compared with the suspected epidemic year 2016 from data in Table 12.        \u00a0Cumulative sum is clearly the most sensitive threshold, followed by the third quartile and then mean + 2 SD. If the district staff were to use the cumulative sum, all the seasonal peaks would be categorized as epidemic. This method should therefore be used only in areas where small increases in the number of malaria cases may be considered an epidemic, as in low transmission settings. \u00a0  In calculating a numerical threshold, it is important to control for wide variation in case counts that results from counting small catchment areas or short periods, such as weekly reporting from village health clinics. Other factors that can affect case counts are changes in diagnostic methods, the availability of treatment, introduction of new service providers such as CHWs and changes in reporting systems.  The threshold should be \u201csmoothed\u201d so that it does not change substantially from week to week. When an area has roughly the same number of cases over several weeks, a jagged alert threshold might result in on-and-off alerts that are potentially costly to investigate and erode confidence in the system.  In countries in which the prevalence of malaria is spatially highly variable, the method used to calculate the threshold should suit the underlying epidemiology of each area."},{"nid":439,"text_data":"6.5.5 Verification of a malaria epidemic  A district management team or equivalent should be established in epidemic-prone areas. The team should comprise a medical officer, an epidemiologist, an entomologist and a trained laboratory technician to verify cases in the field. In areas where coverage of parasitological diagnosis is poor, malaria is often confused with other causes of fever, and additional confirmation in the field may be required to ensure that the reported fevers are the result of malaria infections. Verification of a malaria epidemic may be combined with confirmation of other notifiable febrile diseases to ensure quick response to those diseases as well. The steps in verification of a detected malaria epidemic are:    rapid assessment to confirm that an unusual increase in the number of fever cases is due to malaria; \t laboratory investigation to confirm suspected cases with RDT or microscopy; \t entomological confirmation in collected larval and\/or adult mosquitoes to determine vector control measures to be implemented or whether vector control is necessary at all; and \t immediate notification to the national emergency unit by the district or equivalent monitoring centre if the team determines that there is an epidemic."},{"nid":440,"text_data":"6.6 Preparedness and response  Epidemic preparedness is undertaken at all levels of the health system.

The response will depend on the stage at which the epidemic is detected, but in general the aim is to reduce transmission and mortality by treating those who are infected and preventing new infections. Access to early diagnosis and effective treatment of all malaria patients will minimize mortality. The guiding principles of treatment during epidemics are as follows:    to reduce onward transmission:\t   use a drug that is gametocidal; \t\t use MDA with a long-acting drug, if feasible, to reduce transmission, with good acceptability and compliance and high coverage &gt; 80%. MDA should only be used under certain conditions (see the WHO recommendations and mass drug administration field manual    (23)   ). \t\t use radical cure with primaquine (14-day regimen) in epidemics due to  P. vivax.   \t   \t to reduce mortality:\t   consider mass fever treatment if MDA is not appropriate; \t\t if the epidemic occurs in a remote area with poor access to health care, establish new or temporary health posts (mobile clinics); \t\t ensure early management of severe cases either at peripheral level (early pre-referral or full treatment) or in referral health facilities; and \t\t in epidemics in complex emergency situations, malnutrition and other co-morbid conditions should be managed during malaria case management. \t      For early vector control, target adult mosquitoes to reduce transmission.    \u00a0Operationally, vector control options are viable if epidemic-prone districts are well prepared\u00a0 \u00a0and emergency stocks are pre-disposed and maintained. \t \u00a0Biologically, they are feasible when implemented at an early stage of an epidemic. \t \u00a0IRS is feasible when well conducted, with &gt; 85% coverage rate, and the vector rests\u00a0 \u00a0indoors. IRS can be conducted within 2 weeks of epidemic onset. Similarly, use of ITNs is\u00a0 \u00a0feasible but requires prior behavioural change in the community and impact is less\u00a0 \u00a0immediate than IRS. \t \u00a0In complex emergency situations, where refugee camps can be established, use of ITNs\u00a0 \u00a0and IRS in available structures are highly effective.

Malaria epidemics may affect several countries or territories within a country at the same time. Therefore, exchange of information and data should be part of the response. Examples of operational responses to different stages of malaria epidemics are given in    Annex 19   ."},{"nid":441,"text_data":"6.7 Post-epidemic assessment  A post-epidemic assessment will identify successes and failures of interventions and indicate whether the early warning, detection and response systems have had the expected impact on the burden of malaria. This important exercise is frequently neglected by ministries of health and partners. Thus, lessons are not learnt for use in the event of another epidemic. The results of a post-epidemic assessment are used to improve the preparedness plan and to advocate for the necessary support at all levels of the response. Therefore, the post-epidemic report should be widely distributed to higher levels.  A post-epidemic working group, comprising an epidemiologist, an entomologist, a clinician, a laboratory technician and a statistician from district and national levels, should be set up to assess events retrospectively. The assessment addresses the impact, the response, verification, early detection, early warning and forecasting, in that order.  The working group should examine:    \u00a0the effectiveness of the early warning and detection systems, \t \u00a0the availability of resources and capacity, \t \u00a0the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders during and after the epidemic, \t \u00a0the cost of the response and \t \u00a0the impact of the epidemic and of the interventions.

Monitoring often includes use of administrative data to track inputs, processes and outputs; programme outcomes and impacts may also be included. \u201cEvaluation\u201d involves a more comprehensive assessment of a programme; it is normally undertaken at discrete times and addresses the longer-term outcomes and impacts of programmes. The goal of monitoring and evaluation is to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and equity of programmes. They are critical to achieving the goals of national programmes and tracking progress towards the objectives of the GTS    (5)   . Once the malaria situation in a country or area has been assessed, plans are made to ensure the most effective use of resources to either eliminate malaria or reduce its public health impact. As plans are implemented, they should be reviewed periodically to determine whether the programme activities are achieving the desired outcomes or whether they should be adjusted ( Fig. 22 ).  High-quality, timely information is essential for programme planning and implementation, and the information can also be used to lobby internal and external stakeholders for the necessary resources. The performance of malaria programmes can also be improved by making information on programme planning and monitoring more widely accessible. Public disclosure of information allows politicians, patients and other citizens to monitor the services they are financing and encourages managers to be more responsive to their clients\u2019 needs (see  Box 10 ).  The primary purpose of collecting data on malaria programmes is for decision-making and action at the local level. Information generated at country level is also used to inform progress at international level, through reports produced by WHO and the United Nations. The data inform international financiers of malaria programmes and are an important determinant of future funding.    FIG. 22.

Informal information is learnt by observation, talking to health staff or community leaders and\u00a0other informal means. \t Semi-formal information is obtained, for example, from policy documents, consultants\u2019\u00a0reports,\u00a0supervisory visits, focus group discussions, official circulars and minutes of meetings. \t Formal information is acquired from ordered systems for recording and reporting information,\u00a0such as routine health information and surveillance systems, accounting systems and surveys.    Formal information for programme monitoring can be obtained from:    routine health information systems, which may either cover a number of programmes, be\u00a0specific to malaria or be limited to certain activities (e.g. laboratory services, interventions,\u00a0distribution, surveillance); \t health facility surveys, which usually address whether facilities have the physical and\u00a0 \u00a0human resources necessary to provide services (especially chemoprevention, diagnostic\u00a0testing and treatment), and may include whether patients receive diagnostic testing and\u00a0 \u00a0appropriate treatment; \t household surveys, which usually cover several health interventions, especially for children\u00a0 \u00a0under 5 years of age and women of reproductive age, although malaria-specific surveys\u00a0 \u00a0are\u00a0also common; \t operational research, which usually addresses specific questions of relevance to the\u00a0 \u00a0malaria\u00a0programme, may rely on household or health facility surveys and may include\u00a0 \u00a0studies of drug or insecticide efficacy; \t entomological surveillance, for understanding the distribution of the main malaria vectors,\u00a0their behaviour and changes in their biting habits in response to the intervention; part of\u00a0sentinel surveillance by national programmes and often including vector resistance to\u00a0 \u00a0insecticides; \t data from supervision of health services (central, intermediate, health facility and health\u00a0 \u00a0worker levels); and \t contextual data, which are not collected routinely or during operational research but are\u00a0 \u00a0useful for further understanding and explanation of changing trends in the malaria burden.\u00a0They include population censuses and climate and socioeconomic data.    Data for programme monitoring are usually obtained from routine health information systems and programme data for continuous monitoring. Data from health facility and household surveys may complement those from routine systems (e.g. to compare values of indicators obtained in routine systems and health facility surveys). When routine systems work well, they can provide information continuously from every district or equivalent in a country, and, if other factors are constant, they can be used to detect changes in intervention coverage over time and space or serve as alerts for a possible epidemic.  Incomplete coverage of health information systems can result in a biased sample of the services used by communities (see  Box 1  and  Box 3 ). Often, they do not include private clinics and other nongovernment facilities or cases treated by village health workers or at home. In addition, routine systems seldom function optimally; there is often inconsistent application of reporting definitions and irregular reporting from health facilities and districts to central level. Trends in indicators of intervention coverage are therefore prone to variations in reporting rates. It is important to track the completeness of reporting, not only as an indicator of the functioning of the information system but also for interpreting trends in other indicators."},{"nid":446,"text_data":"7.3.1 Routine systems  In high-transmission settings, malaria accounts for a large proportion of attendance at health services, and malaria information systems are necessarily embedded within integrated HMIS. Simple, efficient recording and reporting systems are required to track vector control activities, notably ITN distribution and IRS coverage. Systems are also required to track resistance to insecticides and antimalarial drugs. In settings with lower transmission or seeking to achieve elimination, malaria-specific reporting systems are required for the additional information demands for targeting and monitoring interventions in particular risk groups and foci."},{"nid":447,"text_data":"7.3.2 Surveys  Information obtained from routine information systems is complemented by data from health facility and household surveys. Surveys can provide data on indicators that cannot be measured from programme data, particularly for indicators that require population-level denominators, such as coverage of interventions and parasite prevalence. Surveys can enrich the interpretation of information from routine systems, such as in ascertaining the percentage of patients with a febrile illness who attend public sector health facilities, thus providing information on the coverage of surveillance systems. Surveys may also be used to validate or triangulate\u00a0data collected in routine systems. They also provide information on child mortality from all causes, which can be related to trends in malaria interventions, incidence and parasite prevalence to illustrate the potential impact of investment in malaria.  The design of surveys depends on the intensity of malaria transmission. In high-transmission settings, nationally representative surveys allow assessment of programme coverage and parasite prevalence throughout the country. In settings with lower transmission, it may be preferable to survey only the populations at greatest risk. Surveys in elimination settings should be limited to foci of transmission.  The relevance of indicators and the feasibility of obtaining particular information through a survey also depend on malaria transmission intensity. For example, the prevalence of parasites among children under the age of 5 years is a relevant indicator in high-transmission settings because they are at high risk for acquiring malaria. It is also practical to obtain information on children under 5 years because they are more likely to be at home during a household survey and available for a malaria test. In low-transmission settings, measuring parasite prevalence in children under 5 years of age may be less informative because, in general, these children are not a high-risk group. It may therefore be preferable to determine the prevalence in all age groups in these settings, although it might be more difficult to obtain a representative sample of schoolchildren and working adults, because they may not be at home when a survey is done. When transmission is low, however, a much larger sample is required to measure prevalence, and household surveys are no longer cost\u2013 effective. The incidence of symptomatic cases is therefore determined from routine health information systems.  A decision about whether to measure parasite prevalence and in which age groups depends on the potential benefits of obtaining the information and thus more precisely identifying the population groups most affected by malaria. These benefits should be weighed against the cost of the survey (i.e. the large sample required), the available diagnostic tools, whether particular population groups can be reached and the other uses to which such resources could be put."},{"nid":449,"text_data":"7.4.1 Programme planning  A principal use of information is in preparing a national strategic plan that defines the goals and objectives of a malaria programme, how they will be achieved and the resources required. The plan should include the roles of different stakeholders in its implementation and set targets for monitoring progress and ensuring accountability. Resources should be allocated to the most effective interventions and to the populations in greatest need in order to maximize reductions in malaria incidence and mortality and minimize wastage of resources. One approach to optimizing responses to malaria in a country or territory is stratification, whereby the area is divided into smaller units in which different combinations of interventions are delivered.  A strategic plan for malaria typically covers 5 years ( Fig. 23 ). It is usually preceded by a review of the malaria situation in the country, to identify the population groups most severely affected by malaria, changes in disease incidence, coverage of malaria interventions and the resources required and available for achieving the targets, as discussed below.    FIG. 23.     Timeframe of a national strategic plan for malaria and programme reviews           Stratification and population at risk    The purpose of stratification is to identify the population groups most severely affected by malaria, the determinants of the malaria risks to which they are exposed in order to target appropriately malaria interventions. Stratification involves identifying the extent of malaria transmission in space and time and the population at risk at any given place or time to better target interventions.  Stratification may require indicators such as parasite prevalence, reported cases, annual parasite incidence and test positivity rates; temperature, rainfall and seasonality; socioeconomic conditions (e.g. poverty and occupation); demographic factors (e.g. age and gender); and access to health care ( Fig. 24 ). Countries usually use a combination of epidemiological, climatic and environmental data for such stratification  (74) . This information can be presented as tables, graphs and maps.  The usefulness of the data described in this framework ( Fig. 24 ) depends on the country context. Often, knowledge of the vector species and its distribution, proportion of population infected, trends in and seasonality of cases and data on rainfall and temperature are sufficient to define areas at risk of malaria.    FIG. 24.     Framework for stratifying malaria risk         In elimination settings with a high-quality surveillance system, analysis of case data and receptivity may be all that is needed to stratify focal transmission. Foci may then be stratified as: with active transmission; receptive and vulnerable; receptive but not vulnerable; and not receptive. Data and potential sources of data for stratifying malaria risk are listed in  Table 13 .  Understandably, malaria risks are affected by highly variable situations such as conflicts and complex emergencies that may lead to epidemics. These require a more dynamic approach, with several data elements for key determinants. Common GIS methods can be used to map epidemic risk with this framework. National programmes that do not have GIS capacity should consult WHO and local partners for assistance.  An example of stratification of annual parasite incidence in a province and in districts within this province in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic is shown in  Fig. 25 .    FIG. 25.     District-level stratification by annual parasite incidence in 2017 in Lao People's Democratic Republic     To further demonstrate heterogeneity of annual parasite incidence within a province, the example of districts within Champasak province is presented (inset).       \u00a0    TABLE 13.     Data elements and potential sources of data for stratifying malaria risk         When interpreting geographical variation in routinely reported malaria incidence or mortality rates, account must be taken of the variation in the proportion of the population that uses public health facilities, the extent of diagnostic testing and health facility reporting rates and the number of new health facilities that have been built and are operational. Hence, it may be useful to tabulate or map general patient attendance, annual blood examinations and health facility reporting rates with tables or maps of disease incidence. It may also be useful to examine geographical variation in test positivity rates or proportional malaria attendance, as these measures may be less distorted by variation in general patient attendance, diagnostic testing or health facility reporting rates.  If available, data from household surveys can provide information on:    whether and where patients seek care for fever and thus the extent to which routine surveillance systems capture all malaria cases; \t parasite prevalence, to identify the populations most severely affected by malaria; and particular risk factors associated with areas of higher incidence or mortality, including predominant vector and parasite species and population behaviour.      Changes in disease incidence    Trends in the number of malaria cases, admissions and deaths reported may reflect changes in malaria transmission and disease incidence in the population. As trends can be influenced by changes in access to health services, diagnostic testing practices and health facility reporting, WHO recommends examining a set of six \u201ccontrol\u201d charts that show not only changes in malaria incidence but also factors that might influence the observed trends ( Fig. 26 ). If there are too many gaps in routinely reported data to assess trends in malaria, a study might have to be undertaken to retrospectively examine the records of patient attendance in a sample of health facilities. If available, data from \u2265 2 years of household surveys provide information on changes in care-seeking behaviour and parasite prevalence.    Fig. 26  shows various charts of malaria trends. It is useful to examine trends in general patient attendance, annual blood examination rate, health facility reporting rates and new health facilities with trends in malaria disease incidence. It is also useful to examine trends in test positivity rates or proportional malaria attendance, as these may be less distorted by changes in general patient attendance, diagnostic testing or health facility reporting rates. In the example in  Fig. 26 , there are fewer malaria cases, inpatients and deaths in the most recent months (graph 1); however, this trend could be due to less reporting and diagnosis in the same period\u00a0(graphs 4 and 5). Such a pattern is common, suggesting that the timeliness of reporting should be improved. Furthermore, the proportion of patients with suspected malaria who receive a diagnostic test should be increased.    FIG. 26.   Charts  for analysis of malaria trends         \u00a0    Fig. 27  presents the example of Rwanda to show how the geographical distribution of malaria can be examined. Mapping of indicators allows programme managers to assess whether programme performance or malaria trends vary by geographical area and to determine whether malaria prevention, testing or treatment activities should be focused in particular geographical areas. Regional differences in the numbers of cases and deaths due to malaria might reflect the underlying epidemiology, the extent of malaria interventions or diagnostic and case reporting practices. In the example below, higher case incidence rates are observed in eastern parts of the country, with higher annual blood examination rates and percentages of cases tested. Nonetheless, the same areas have a higher incidence rate, as suggested by higher test positivity rates. Variation in the completeness of reporting may be due to communication delays or resource gaps in particular regions.    FIG. 27. Geographical distribution of malaria in Rwanda in 2015           Coverage of malaria interventions    It is useful to determine intervention coverage by geographical area or population risk group, to assess whether interventions have been targeted appropriately. It is also useful to examine different stages in the delivery of interventions to identify any bottlenecks that hinder service provision. In the two scenarios shown in Fig. 28, the proportions of pregnant women receiving four or more doses of intermittent preventive treatment are the same \u2013 and low, but the reasons for the low coverage differ. In the scenario on the left, although use of antenatal care services is good, women do not receive multiple doses of preventive treatment, suggesting that the services offered at antenatal clinics should be improved. In the second scenario, use of antenatal clinics is poor, suggesting that more fixed or mobile antenatal clinics should be provided. Information on the coverage of malaria interventions can be obtained from routine reporting systems, household surveys and health facility surveys.  FIG. 28.      Identifying bottlenecks in malaria programmes           Resources required and available for achieving programme targets    Information on programme fina ncing should include both domestic and international financing. All malaria-specific expenditure should be included; for example, on commodities (e.g. ITNs, RDTs and ACT), equipment (e.g. microscopes and vehicles), staffing (malaria managers and indoor residual sprayers) and activities (e.g. training and supervision). If expenditure that is shared with other programmes can be readily apportioned to malaria programmes, they should be added to malariaspecific expenditures. If not, a focus on malaria-specific expenditures is often sufficient for assessing trends in malaria investments and their impact on programme coverage. It is also useful to examine programme financing by geographical area or population risk group."},{"nid":450,"text_data":"7.4.2 Programme monitoring and evaluation  The national malaria strategic plan should be monitored at regular intervals to assess coverage of interventions, their impact and determine whether programmes are proceeding as intended or adjustments are required. Managers at national level should review the indicators at least every quarter. Annual reviews should also be undertaken before budgets are prepared, mid-term reviews may be conducted to assess interim progress, and a final programme review should be undertaken before the next strategic plan is developed. The final malaria programme review (and mid-term review) benefits from data from health facility surveys, household surveys and other special studies; therefore, these surveys and studies should be timed to contribute to the review(s).  In reviewing indicators, managers should ask specific questions regarding the progress of malaria programmes. The precise questions will depend on the local operational context, but are likely to include the following:    Are programme coverage targets being met, or are particular interventions (e.g. target for percentage of suspected cases tested) experiencing problems? Are there stock-outs of commodities? \t Have there been important changes in the values of indicators over time? For example, has there been a decrease in the number of children receiving ITNs through immunization clinics? Of particular interest is whether the numbers of cases and deaths are being reduced or whether problems are being experienced in some locations, necessitating modification of the programme. Managers should also be alert to potential epidemics. \t Are there particular bottlenecks in the delivery of services? For example, is there a large difference in the number of pregnant women receiving first and third doses of intermittent preventive treatment? \t Are particular health facilities or geographical areas experiencing problems (e.g. low testing rate, prescription of inappropriate drugs, low reporting rates) or doing well? \t Is the surveillance system working well, or are there problems in case detection, reporting completeness, timeliness and coverage, registration of foci? \t Are management and human resource challenges at all levels of the programme?    These questions can be answered easily if data are presented in such a way that indicators can be compared with targets, across time, with other indicators and between geographical areas. Other comparisons may also be informative; for example, those between different types of facilities or providers of services.  Managers at health facility and district levels should review indicators each month, or more frequently in the case of elimination. Feedback on the status of selected key indicators should be communicated to districts and health facilities weekly, monthly or quarterly, depending on the epidemiological context and should include private health facilities when possible.  Health facility and intermediate-level (e.g. district) teams should be engaged in data analysis, presentation and interpretation to improve their involvement, performance and programme capacity. Data should be summarized in ways that allow staff in health facilities and districts to readily assess their facilities\u2019 performance. Data may be presented on a dashboard, by ranking districts or facilities or by colour-coding indicators according to their value.  Programmes should not be monitored only by malaria programme managers and implementers. Other government departments, elected leaders, community members and donors have a stake in ensuring the high quality of malaria programmes and should be able to assess the operations they are supporting. When these stakeholders are involved in the review process, they can help to ensure that malaria programmes are responding to the population\u2019s needs and that malaria control and elimination are promoted as a development priority."},{"nid":451,"text_data":"7.4.3 Monitoring and evaluation of surveillance systems  Surveillance systems that function well are the backbone of effective malaria interventions at all levels of transmission intensity. Surveillance systems support planning, budgeting, evaluation and tracking of programme activities and disease trends. The better the surveillance system, the more likely it is that a programme will have an impact for the resources invested.  The purpose of monitoring and evaluating surveillance systems is to track the progress of the system and to identify any bottlenecks that impede its efficient functioning. This information should be the basis for investments to improve the surveillance system. Monitoring and evaluation involve critical assessment of the four main components of a surveillance system: structure, core functions, support functions and quality ( Fig. 29 ). Various elements of each component are measured during surveillance; a few are presented in  Table 14 .  Monitoring and evaluation of surveillance should be used to determine whether the objectives and approaches defined in the national surveillance SOP have been achieved. The SOP should include the broad governing structures of the surveillance system, the processes, sources of information, methods and frequency of data collection, data quality and analysis and use of information and should be specified in the monitoring and evaluation plan.  The surveillance system can be evaluated in four stages: planning, preparation, evaluation and dissemination    (1)   . During planning, decide on the scope of the evaluation and the general timing, and explore the broad resource requirements for the assessments. The preparatory stage includes deciding on the indicators to be measured and the assessment protocol, methods and tools. Quantify in greater detail the resources required according to the type of assessment, and identify people to conduct the evaluation. The evaluation stage includes field work and data entry, cleaning, verification and analysis. At this stage, a summary report of the evaluation is prepared, which includes the background of the evaluation, objectives, methods, results, conclusions and recommendations. The results of the evaluation should be disseminated to all stakeholders and should used as a basis for improving the surveillance system.  The status of surveillance systems should be assessed periodically (at least every 2 years) in settings in which the burden of malaria is being reduced and once a year in elimination settings, if not more frequently. This will provide input for effective systems for surveillance, monitoring and evaluation.    FIG. 29.     Components of a surveillance and response system to be assessed by\u00a0monitoring and evaluation    (1)             \u00a0    TABLE 14.

The indicators take into account:    \u00a0the resources available for malaria control (programme financing, commodities); \t \u00a0levels of service provision (intervention coverage) and the performance of systems for\u00a0 \u00a0surveillance, monitoring and evaluation; and \t \u00a0trends in infection and disease.    Twelve of the 46 indicators are considered to be core indicators (shaded), and the other 31 are supporting indicators. The applicability of an indicator in a programme settings is shown as generally highly relevant (a closed circle) or potentially relevant (open circle). The settings considered include the level of transmission, whether a country is in sub-Saharan Africa and the administrative level.  Although some interventions are important at all stages of malaria control and elimination (e.g. ensuring that all patients with suspected malaria receive a diagnostic test), a particular indicator may have lower priority than others as the programme evolves. Thus, if 100% of suspected cases routinely receive a diagnostic test, this indicator may not be considered as strong in routine monitoring of an elimination programme as one that reflects the proportion of cases investigated. The recommended indicators for programmes close to elimination reflect this reprioritization. Eight indicators (7.1\u20137.8) concern the performance of systems for surveillance monitoring and evaluation."},{"nid":453,"text_data":"7.6 Use of information at regional and global levels  Global progress in reducing mortality and morbidity due to malaria and its eventual elimination will be tracked on the basis of countries\u2019 surveillance, monitoring and evaluation systems. Progress will be monitored from the indicators listed in  Table 14 . Countries and partners are encouraged to ensure that data for these indicators are available at appropriate times during implementation of the GTS by ensuring adequate investment in routine information systems and in household and health facility surveys.  WHO and other partners will support countries that are endemic for malaria in strengthening their surveillance, monitoring and evaluation systems, in line with the requirements of the GTS. The aim of the support will be to improve the quality, availability and management of data on malaria and to optimize use of such data in decision-making and programmatic responses. Countries will also be supported in identifying nationally appropriate targets and indicators for subregional monitoring of progress.  WHO, in line with its core role, will monitor regional and global trends in malaria and make these data available to countries and to global malaria partners. WHO will monitor implementation of the GTS and regularly evaluate progress towards the milestones and goals set for 2020, 2025 and 2030 ( Table 15 ) in annual and other periodic reports. It will also support monitoring of the efficacy of medicines and vector-control interventions; to this end, WHO will maintain global databases for the efficacy of medicines and insecticide resistance. WHO will regularly report to the regional and global governing bodies of WHO, the United Nations General Assembly and other United Nations bodies.  By 2030, malaria morbidity and mortality are expected to have been reduced dramatically in comparison with 2015, with future eradication of malaria in sight. In this context, it will be increasingly necessary to establish a global monitoring system to systematically track and eliminate the remaining cases and foci of malaria.    TABLE 15.

It may also be used as follow-on treatment in severe malaria when the patient is well enough to take oral medication.  Amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine\u2013pyrimethamine (SP) is given at full treatment doses at monthly intervals as seasonal malaria chemoprevention to young children (aged 3\u201359 months) in areas of seasonal, high-intensity malaria transmission. This combination is currently recommended in the Sahel region of sub-Saharan Africa in areas where malaria transmission is intense and where the majority (&gt;60%) of clinical malaria cases occur during a short period (\u2264 4 months) (2). Artesunate\u2013amodiaquine should not be used for prophylaxis, as its accumulation increases the risks for hepatotoxicity and agranulocytosis (1).    Structure and mechanism of action    Amodiaquine is a Mannich base 4-aminoquinoline that is similar in structure and mechanism of action to chloroquine. Amodiaquine is converted to its active metabolite desethylamodiaquine and is thought to act by accumulating inside the parasite food vacuole and interfering with haem detoxification. Amodiaquine is effective against some parasite strains that are resistant to chloroquine, although some cross- resistance exists (1, 3).         Pharmacokinetics    The pharmacokinetic parameters of amodiaquine is presented in Table A5.1.    Table A5.1. Pharmacokinetic parameters reported for amodiaquine and its active metabolite desethylamodiaquine in studies of currently recommended dosages for treatment of uncomplicated malaria or seasonal malaria chemoprevention (range of mean or median values reported).         Amodiaquine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and rapidly converted by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme CYP2C8 into desethylamodiaquine, which contributes nearly all the antimalarial effect. While amodiaquine is eliminated rapidly, desethylamodiaquine is eliminated more slowly, with a terminal half-life of 4\u201310 days (4\u201313).    Safety        Adverse events      Artesunate\u2013amodiaquine is generally well tolerated but is associated with a higher incidence of gastrointestinal disturbances, including nausea and abdominal pain, than other ACTs (14, 15). Other commonly reported adverse events include cough, anorexia, insomnia, fatigue and weakness (4, 6, 16\u201318). Serious adverse events associated with amodiaquine are neutropenia and hepatotoxicity (19\u201322). While these effects were most often associated with prolonged use of amodiaquine (as prophylaxis), they have also been observed with short-course artesunate\u2013 amodiaquine treatment. Less common events that have been reported include arrhythmia, bradycardia, vomiting, extrapyramidal effects and pruritus (14, 15, 23, 24). Eye disorders, varying in type and severity have been reported, including transient accommodation disorders and corneal opacification, which regressed once treatment was stopped, and, very rarely, irreversible retinopathy (3).  Amodiaquine + SP is generally well tolerated in children, and no serious adverse events have been reported (9, 25\u201328); however, a tendency to higher frequencies of vomiting, loss of appetite, fever and mild-to-moderate skin reactions have been reported after administration of amodiaquine + SP as compared with placebo.      Contraindications       Amodiaquine should not be administered to patients with known hypersensitivity and should be avoided in patients with a history of hepatotoxicity, hepatic impairment, neutropenia or retinopathy.      Cautions      Although seasonal malaria chemoprevention with amodiaquine + SP is generally effective in preventing malaria, breakthrough infections may occur. It is important that parents or guardians continue to use other malaria prevention measures (such as insecticide-treated bednets) and monitor their children; they should seek medical attention immediately in the event of febrile illness. Should malaria infection occur while the child is on amodiaquine + SP, the treatment chosen should not include either amodiaquine or SP.  Cardiovascular effects have been reported during high-dose treatment with other 4-aminoquinoline derivatives. There is no evidence, however, that an overdose of amodiaquine causes any of the life-threatening cardiovascular complications seen with overdose of chloroquine. Caution should nevertheless be exercised in treating patients who have recently taken another antimalarial drug with cardiovascular side-effects, such as quinine or mefloquine.    Pragmatic dosing    Fixed dose artesunate + amodiaquine result in better treatment efficacy than loose tablets (29). Antimalarial dosing has often been based on age because access to formal health services or functioning weighing scales is often limited in malaria- endemic countries. While age-based dosing is more practical, it carries a risk for potential under- or over-dosing of more patients. Large datasets of weight-for-age have been used to determine suitable age-based dosing for African children (30), which resulted in higher proportions of patients receiving therapeutic doses of artesunate and amodiaquine. To simplify dosage recommendations in other regions, anthropometric data should be collated for each malaria-endemic region and the data re-modelled accordingly.    References    1.

Although artemether was superior to quinine in the treatment of severe malaria in adults (but not in children), its absorption is unpredictable, which may affect treatment responses in the most severely ill patients. \t Artemether is an alternative for pre-referral treatment of severe malaria in adults when parenteral artesunate is not available and in children when neither parenteral nor rectal artesunate is available. \t Artemether is also used in a fixed-dose oral combination with lumefantrine (see A5.3) for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria caused by P.  falciparum , P.  vivax , P. ovale, P.  malariae  or P.  knowlesi  parasites.      Structure and mechanism of action    Artemether is the methyl ether derivative of dihydroartemisinin. It is two- to threefold less active than dihydroartemisinin, its active metabolite. The ethers are metabolized to dihydroartemisinin to a lesser extent than artesunate. Like the other artemisinin derivatives, artemether has broad stage specificity against blood-stage parasites, from the ring stages through to early schizonts. It also reduces gametocyte carriage, limiting malaria transmission from the treated infection (1, 2).         Pharmacokinetics    Table A5.2 shows the pharmacokinetic parameters of artemether when given by intramuscular injection for the treatment of severe malaria. The pharmacokinetics of oral artemether when given in the fixed-dose combination with lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria is shown in section A5.3.    Table A5.2. pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for artemether and its active metabolite dihydroartemisinin in studies of currently recommended doses of intramuscular artemether for treatment of severe malaria (range of mean or median values reported)         Note that the estimates of Vd and Cl assume complete bioavailability.  Artemether is a water-insoluble, lipid-soluble compound and is therefore given either as an oil-based intramuscular injection or orally. It is absorbed slowly and erratically after intramuscular administration in severe malaria (Figure A5.2) (3, 4). Artemether is approximately 95% bound to plasma proteins. It is converted, primarily by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, into dihydroartemisinin. While dihydroartemisinin is responsible for most of the antimalarial action after oral administration, the concentrations of artemether parent compound predominate after intramuscular administration in severe falciparum malaria. Artemether also undergoes auto-induction but to a lesser extent than artemisinin. Both artemether and dihydroartemisinin are eliminated within 7 h of administration (3, 5\u201310).  F igure A5.2. Individual concentration\u2013time profiles for artemether after the first intramuscular dose of 3.2 mg\/kg to 10 adult Vietnamese patients with severe falciparum malaria (2).           Safety         Adverse effects       Artemether is generally very well tolerated after both oral and intramuscular administration. It has similar side-effects to other artemisinin derivatives, including hypersensitivity reactions (risk estimate, 1 in 3000), mild gastrointestinal disturbance, dizziness, reticulocytopenia, neutropenia and elevated liver enzyme activity. Although no electrocardiographic abnormalities were found in most studies, bradycardia and very slight prolongation of the QT interval have been reported. While studies in experimental animals show neurotoxicity after parenteral artemether, clinical, neurophysiological and pathological studies in humans have not shown similar findings.      Contraindications       Artemether is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any artemisinin derivative.      Cautions       A marked increase in the concentration of artemether in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with meningitis was observed, prompting researchers to advise caution in treating patients with signs of meningitis (2, 10, 11).  Patients with acute renal failure have higher maximum concentrations, higher exposure, a lower volume of distribution and a longer elimination half-life of artemether than people without renal failure (6).

Structure and mechanism of action    Lumefantrine (benflumetol) is a fluorene derivative belonging to the aryl amino-alcohol group of antimalarials, which includes quinine, halofantrine and mefloquine (1). It is thought to work similarly to the other members of the group by preventing haem detoxification within the parasite food vacuole, thus causing accumulation of the toxic haem complex (2). Lumefantrine is not available as and has not been used as monotherapy, which should slow the selection and spread of resistance to this drug.    Pharmacokinetics    The pharmacokinetic parameters of artemether\u2013lumefantrine are presented in Table A5.3 (6\u201329).    Table A5.3. Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for artemether, lumefantrine and their respective active metabolites, dihydroartemisinin and desbutyllumefantrine in studies of currently recommended doses of artemether\u2013 lumefantrine used for treatment of acute malaria (range of mean or median values reported).         Artemether is more lipophilic than other artemisinin derivatives and is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 2 h of oral administration. It is then converted, primarily by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 enzymes, into dihydroartemisinin which is responsible for most of the antimalarial action. Artemether also undergoes auto-induction (3). Both artemether and dihydroartemisinin are eliminated rapidly.  Lumefantrine is highly lipophilic and is more readily absorbed when co-administered with fatty foods or milk (4, 5, 7). Its bioavailability and the time to reach maximum concentrations vary within and between individuals, primarily due to fat-dependent absorption. The absorption of lumefantrine is close to saturation at currently recommended doses, so increasing the dose does not result in a proportional increase in exposure (6, 11); similar non-linear relations between dose and bioavailability are well described for other highly lipophilic drugs. Lumefantrine exhibits high plasma protein binding (99.7%) and has an elimination half-life of ~3 days. It is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by the CYP3A4 enzymes (2, 30). Its active metabolite is desbutyl-lumefantrine (31).    Safety        Adverse events      Artemether\u2013lumefantrine has a wide therapeutic index and is generally well tolerated, with reported side-effects such as nausea, dizziness and headache that are not easily distinguishable from symptoms of acute malaria (13, 28, 32\u201335). Artemether\u2013lumefantrine does not significantly prolong the QTc interval (36).      Contraindications      Artemether\u2013lumefantrine should not to be administered to patients with known hypersensitivity to either artemether or lumefantrine.    Cautions    Artemether\u2013lumefantrine has not been studied extensively in patients &gt; 65 years or children weighing &lt; 5 kg. so these patients should be monitored closely when taking this medication. The manufacturer advises against administration to patients with congenital or clinical conditions resulting in QTc prolongation, a family history of congenital long QT syndrome or sudden death or those with electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia, which may affect cardiac conductivity, although there is no evidence for iatrogenic toxicity in these groups (37).      Drug interactions      See Table A5.14.    Dosage recommendations      Formulations currently available:\u00a0 Dispersible or standard tablets containing 20 mg of artemether and 120 mg of lumefantrine in a fixed-dose combination formulation. The flavoured dispersible tablet paediatric formulation facilitates use in young children.    Dose optimization:\u00a0 To evaluate the feasibility of dose optimization, a population model of the pharmacokinetics of lumefantrine was constructed at the Mahidol\u2013 Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit from pooled concentration\u2013time data for 1390 patients in four countries (Papua New Guinea, Thailand, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania). Body weights from 8 to 70 kg were well represented. A saturation model was used to describe the dose-limited absorption. The current dose recommendations resulted in similar day-7 lumefantrine plasma concentrations in all non-pregnant patients, except for the smallest children (weighing 5\u201314 kg). Because of dose-limited absorption, however, it is uncertain whether increases in individual doses would result in predictably higher lumefantrine exposure in these young children. Extended or more frequent dosing regimens should be evaluated prospectively in this age group.    References    1.  Guidelines for the treatment of malaria .

Structure and mechanism of action    Artesunate is a hemisuccinate derivative of dihydroartemisinin, which is obtained by the reduction of artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide (1).  f , artesunate is rapidly converted to its active metabolite dihydroartemisinin. The mechanism of action of the artemisinin derivatives is not well-defined but involves cation-mediated generation of reactive intermediates and reduction of the peroxide bridge.  Artesunate, like other artemisinin derivatives, kills all erythrocytic stages of malaria parasites, including the ring stages and early schizonts, as well as the gametocytes responsible for continuing transmission, although it has only partial activity against the mature stage V gametocytes. It is essentially inactive against extra-erythrocytic forms, sporozoites, liver schizonts and merozoites. Artesunate is more water-soluble than other artemisinins and therefore can be administered intravenously. It can also be given orally, rectally or by the intramuscular route.         Pharmacokinetics    The pharmacokinetic parameters of intravenous, intramuscular, rectal and oral artesunate are presented in Table 5.4 (1\u201332). Artesunate is rapidly absorbed and biotransformed into its active metabolite dihydroartemisinin by plasma esterases, with a possible contribution from CYP2A6 enzymes. While dihydroartemisinin accounts for nearly all the antimalarial activity of oral artesunate, artesunate contributes more significantly to the antimalarial effect after intravenous administration. Peak concentrations of artesunate are reached within a few minutes of parenteral administration; thereafter, artesunate is rapidly eliminated. Plasma protein binding of dihydroartemisinin is approximately 93%. Dihydroartemisinin is metabolized in the gut and liver by glucuronidation and is excreted in the urine.    Table A5.4. Pharmacokinetic parameters of artesunate and its active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin (DHA), when given intravenously, intramuscularly or rectally for the treatment of severe malaria or orally for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria (range of mean or median values reported).           Safety        Pregnancy      In experimental animals, dose-dependent fetal toxicity was observed after administration of artesunate in the first trimester and was more likely to occur with increased duration of treatment (1). There is no evidence that artemisinin derivatives are teratogenic in humans, but experience is still limited. While the possible risk for teratogenicity limits the use of artemisinin derivatives in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in women in the first trimester, treatment of severe malaria with artesunate is recommended as it is potentially life-saving for the mother. Artesunate has been successfully and safely administered in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (1, 33).      Adverse events      Artesunate is generally well-tolerated and has a better safety profile than quinine in severe malaria (34\u201337). It has similar side-effects to other artemisinin derivatives, including hypersensitivity reactions (risk estimate, 1 in 3000), gastrointestinal disturbances, cough, rash, arthralgia, dizziness and delayed haemolysis. Clinically, the most significant effect is haemolysis, which has been reported up to weeks after treatment (38) (see section 7.4.1). Dose-dependent neutropenia was observed in Cambodia, where an oral dose of 6 mg\/kg bw artesunate for 7 days resulted in significantly lower neutrophil counts than in those patients given 2 or 4 mg\/kg bw (39). Other adverse effects observed in animal models, such as hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity, have not been observed in clinical studies at therapeutic doses (40\u201342). Although there is a theoretical concern about bradycardia and QTc prolongation associated with artemisinin derivatives, particularly at high doses, this has not been seen with artesunate (16).      Contraindications      Artesunate is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to artesunate or artemisinin derivatives.      Cautions      As lower plasma concentrations of artesunate and dihydroartemisinin are reported in young children with severe anaemia, it is important to monitor their response to treatment closely.  While use of artesunate in patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been studied extensively, the limited data available (and the known metabolism and excretion of drug) do not suggest that artesunate would be toxic to renally or hepatically impaired individuals. Nevertheless, caution is advised in treating these patients.      Drug interactions      See Table A5.14.    Dosage optimization    For the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, the target dose of artesunate remains 4 mg\/kg bw daily, with a daily dose range of 2\u201310 mg\/kg bw. Children weighing &lt; 25 kg with severe malaria had lower exposure to intravenous or intramuscular artesunate and its active metabolite dihydroartemisinin than older children and adults given the same dose of 2.4 mg\/kg bw (9), which was attributed to an increased clearance rate in younger children. This may increase the risk for treatment failure, which can be fatal in severe malaria. The Mahidol\u2013Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit performed nonlinear mixed-effects population pharmacokinetics modelling in order to inform WHO dosage recommendations for ensuring equivalent exposure to the drug for all target populations. These models confirmed that young children (&lt; 25 kg\/5 years) should receive a slightly higher dose of 3 mg\/kg (see  section 7.4.1 ), which is still within the therapeutic range prescribed by the manufacturer and does not raise safety concerns.

Structure and mechanism of action    Atovaquone is a hydroxynaphthoquinone with antimalarial activity against all stages of all\u00a0 Plasmodium species \u00a0(1). It is an ubiquinone analogue that inhibits the transport of several parasite enzymes and interferes with the cytochrome electron transport system, resulting in the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential (1, 2). Atovaquone\u2013proguanil is seldom used in endemic areas because of the propensity for emergence of high-grade resistance to atovaquone from single mutations in the cyt b gene (3). Proguanil is a biguanide compound that is active against all stages of the malaria parasite life cycle. In  vivo , it is converted into an active triazine metabolite, cycloguanil, which acts by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase (2, 4). The combination of atovaquone and proguanil is synergistic, but it is the parent compound rather than the metabolite that synergizes, independently of its antifol metabolite, lowering the effective concentration at which atovaquone collapses the mitochondrial membrane potential (4).         Molecular mass: 366.8           Molecular mass: 253.7      Pharmacokinetics    Table A5.5 summarizes the pharmacokinetic parameters of atovaquone\u2013proguanil (5\u201313). Atovaquone is a highly lipophilic compound, and there is considerable inter-individual variation in its absorption. Atovaquone\u2013proguanil should be taken at the same time each day with food or a milky drink, as atovaquone is generally poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; the absolute oral bioavailability is approximately 23% when taken with food (14). In contrast, proguanil is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, reaching peak concentrations within approximately 5 h of administration. Atovaquone is 99% bound to plasma proteins and has a long plasma half-life (~2\u20133 days) because of enterohepatic recycling. It is excreted almost exclusively in the faeces as unchanged drug (14). Proguanil is 75% protein bound and undergoes hepatic biotransformation via CYP2C19 (and possibly CYP3A4) into the antifolate metabolite cycloguanil (10, 14). Between 40 and 60% of proguanil is excreted by the kidneys (14). The apparent clearance (Cl\/f) of both atovaquone and proguanil is related to body weight (14). While most of the pharmacokinetics of proguanil and cycloguanil is comparable in adults and children, the elimination half-life of atovaquone is shorter in children (9, 14). The plasma concentrations of atovaquone and proguanil in women in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy are approximately half those of non-pregnant adults (with and without acute malaria) as a result of a greater Vd and increased oral clearance.    Table A5.5. Pharmacokinetic parameters of atovaquone, proguanil and cycloguanil in studies of currently recommended doses for malaria prophylaxis or treatment (range of mean or median values reported).           Safety        Pregnancy      Atovaquone\u2013proguanil is regarded as safe in pregnancy, as no evidence of adverse effects associated with its use was found in studies in pregnant humans or experimental animals (2, 7, 8, 14).      Adverse effects      Generally atovaquone\u2013proguanil is well tolerated. The side-effects of atovaquone\u2013 proguanil are similar in children and adults (9, 14). The most common adverse effects reported are headache, cough and gastrointestinal disturbances (such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea). Other adverse events occur rarely, such as dizziness and oral ulceration, and, very rarely, blood disorders including neutropenia and anaemia and skin reactions such as photosensitivity rash and erythema multiforme. Raised liver enzyme activities, hepatitis and hepatic failure have been reported. Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome and vasculitis may rarely occur. Pancytopenia in patients with severe renal impairment treated with proguanil has been reported, probably because of drug accumulation (15).      Contraindications      Atovaquone\u2013proguanil is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity reactions to atovaquone or proguanil. It is also contraindicated as malaria prophylaxis in patients with severe renal impairment because of the high risk for pancytopenia.      Caution      In the elderly, doses should be selected cautiously, taking into account the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, higher systemic exposure to cycloguanil and a greater frequency of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (14).      Drug interactions      See Table A5.14. The main concern is the approximate twofold reduction in plasma concentrations of both atovaquone and proguanil (7, 8), which could leave pregnant women more susceptible to malaria infection or at risk for treatment failure. Further clinical and dose-optimization studies in pregnancy are required. Additional strategies are strongly advised for pregnant women taking atovaquone\u2013 proguanil for malaria prevention.

Structure and mechanism of action    Chloroquine is a 4-aminoquinoline that inhibits intraparasitic haem detoxification (2); it may also interfere with the biosynthesis of nucleic acids. Chloroquine reaches high concentrations in the parasite\u2019s food vacuole. Chloroquine resistance is associated with genetic mutations in genes encoding trans-membrane proteins of the parasite\u2019s food vacuole (PfCRT and PfMDR) (3).         Pharmacokinetics    Table A5.6 summarizes the pharmacokinetic properties of chloroquine (4\u201315). Chloroquine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration (16). Plasma protein binding is approximately 55%. Chloroquine is extensively distributed in body tissues and fluids, including the placenta and breast milk. It is metabolized in the liver by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 enzymes, mainly to monodesethylchloroquine, which has similar antimalarial activity (17). The drug is eliminated slowly from the body , with ~55% eliminated via the kidneys.    Table A5.6. Pharmacokinetic properties of chloroquine and desethylchloroquine in studies of currently recommended doses for malaria prophylaxis or treatment (range of mean or median values reported).           Safety        Pregnancy      At the doses used for treatment or prophylaxis of\u00a0 P. vixax, P. ovale or P. malaria , chlororoquine is considered safe in pregnancy (18, 19). The chloroquine concentrations achieved are reportedly lower during pregnancy, particularly in the second and third trimesters (11,21), although one studies showed no such difference (20). The response of pregnant patients to treatment should be monitored closely.      Adverse effects      Chloroquine is generally well tolerated at therapeutic doses. Large doses used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis are associated with a higher frequency of adverse events than the lower doses used in malaria. Pruritus is a common side- effect and is more severe in dark-skinned individuals. Other less common side- effects include headache, hepatitis, elevated liver enzyme, various skin eruptions and gastrointestinal disturbances, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Taking chloroquine with food helps to avoid gastrointestinal intolerance. Chloroquine causes slight widening of the QRS complex and QT intervals in electrocardiography but has not been associated with conduction disturbances or arrhythmia at therapeutic doses. More rarely, central nervous system toxicity, including convulsions and mental changes, may occur. Chronic use (&gt; 5 years continuous use as prophylaxis) may lead to eye disorders, including keratopathy and retinopathy. Other uncommon effects include myopathy, reduced hearing, photosensitivity and hair loss. Blood disorders, such as aplastic anaemia, are extremely uncommon. Acute overdosage is very dangerous, and death can occur within a few hours. The patient may progress from feeling dizzy and drowsy with headache and gastrointestinal upset, to sudden visual loss, convulsions, hypokalaemia, hypotension and cardiac arrhythmia. Overdosed patients require intensive care.      Contraindications      Chloroquine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to chloroquine or any aminoquinoline compounds.      Caution      Use with caution in patients with psoriasis, neurological (e.g. epilepsy), retinal, or gastrointestinal disorders, as chloroquine may exacerbate these underlying conditions. The drug should also be administered with caution to patients with retinal or visual impairment or hepatic impairment.      Drug interactions      See Table A5.14.    References    1.

Structure and mechanism    of action Clindamycin is a lincosamide antibiotic derived from lincomycin. Its mechanism of action involves inhibition of microbial protein synthesis by preferential binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit and interference with peptide chain initiation (1, 2).      Molecular mass: 425.0      Pharmacokinetics    The pharmacokinetic parameters reported for clindamycin are summarized in Table A5.7. Clindamycin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with an oral bioavailability of approximately 90% (3). It is widely distributed in body fluids and tissues, including bone, but insignificant levels are reached in cerebrospinal fluid. Clindamycin also crosses the placenta and appears in breast milk (4). It is about 90% bound to plasma proteins and accumulates in leukocytes, macrophages and bile (3). The half-life of clindamycin may be prolonged and clearance reduced in neonates and patients with renal impairment (5, 6). Clindamycin is metabolized by CYP3A4 enzymes in the liver into the active\u00a0 N-demethyl\u00a0 and sulfoxide metabolites and some inactive metabolites (7). About 10% of a dose is excreted in the urine as active drug or metabolites and about 4% in faeces; the remainder is excreted as inactive metabolites. Excretion is slow and takes place over many days. Although clearance is reduced slightly in patients with markedly reduced renal function, dose modification is not considered necessary (3). Clindamycin is not effectively removed from the body by dialysis.    Table A5.7. Pharmacokinetic parameters of clindamycin (range of mean or median values reported).           Safety    Studies of reproductive toxicity with clindamycin in experimental animals revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetusf. Although data on its use during pregnancy in humans are limited, clindamycin is regarded as safe for use in pregnancy.      Adverse events      Clindamycin is generally well tolerated after oral administration. Its major disadvantage is its potential to cause antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, leading to overgrowth of\u00a0 Clostridium difficile \u00a0and pseudomembranous colitis (3). Other adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or cramps, rash or pruritis. High doses of clindamycin may cause a metallic taste in the mouth. Rarely, clindamycin therapy has been associated with anaphylaxis, blood dyscrasia (leukopenia, agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia), erythema multiforme, polyarthritis, jaundice, raised liver enzymes and hepatotoxicity. Some parenteral formulations contain benzyl alcohol, which may cause fatal \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d in neonates.      Contraindications      Clindamycin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to clindamycin or lincomycin.      Cautions      Clindamycin should be used with caution in patients with gastrointestinal diseases as they may be at greater risk for pseudomembranous colitis. Caution is also advised in administering clindamycin to severely ill elderly patients, who may be more likely than younger patients to develop diarrhoea. The longer elimination half-life of clindamycin in neonates means that its plasma concentration may be significantly higher than in older children (5, 6). For this reason, close monitoring of organ function is required when clindamycin is administered to neonates, particularly if they were premature. Clearance of clindamycin is reduced in patients with moderate-to-severe liver disease, so dosage modification (increasing the interval between doses) may be needed.  Greater bioavailability, higher serum protein binding, lower plasma drug clearance and a smaller steady-state volume of distribution have been found in patients with HIV\/AIDS than in healthy volunteers (10, 13). Although the clinical significance of these findings has not yet been established, close monitoring of these patients is recommended (Drug interactions. See Table A5.14).    References    1.

It may also be used as follow-on treatment in severe malaria once the patient is well enough to take oral medication.    Structure and mechanism of action    Dihydroartemisinin is a sesquiterpene peroxide and an active metabolite of artesunate and artemether (2, 3). The mechanism of action of the artemisinin derivatives is not known but involves cation- mediated generation of reactive intermediates and reduction of the peroxide bridge.  Piperaquine is a bisquinoline compound of the 4-aminoquinoline group of antimalarial drugs that include chloroquine (2). Piperaquine is thought to act similarly to chloroquine, which accumulates inside the parasite food vacuole and inhibits parasite-mediated haem detoxification, causing accumulation of the toxic haem complex (4).  Piperaquine is also effective against chloroquine-resistant malaria parasites (5, 6). In chloroquine resistance, mutations in the genes encoding trans-membrane parasite food vacuole proteins are thought to result in efflux of chloroquine, so that it cannot accumulate at its site of action (7). These mutated parasite membrane proteins are considered to be unable to efflux the bulky bisquinoline structure (4).         Molecular mass: 284.4           Molecular mass: 535.5      Pharmacokinetic parameters    Dihydroartemisinin\u2013piperaquine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with peak plasma concentrations reached within 1\u20133 h for dihydroartemisinin and 3\u20136 h for piperaquine. Piperaquine is extensively distributed throughout the body, with more than 99% bound to plasma proteins (3, 8\u201319).  Dihydroartemisinin has a smaller volume of distribution and plasma protein binding of 44\u201393%. Elimination of dihydroartemisinin is much more rapid (elimination half-life, about 1 h) than that of piperaquine (2\u20134 weeks) (3, 9, 10, 15).    Table A5.8. Pharmacokinetic parameters of dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine in studies of manufacturer-recommended dosages in patients treated for acute uncomplicated malaria (range of mean or median values reported).           Safety        Adverse events      Overall, dihydroartemisinin\u2013piperaquine was well tolerated in large randomized controlled trials. The adverse effects reported included nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting, as well as anorexia, anaemia, dizziness, headache, sleep disturbance and cough (2, 20\u201328).  Although there was no evidence of cardiotoxicity in large randomized trials and extensive use of dihydroartemisinin\u2013piperaquine, piperaquine does prolong the QT interval on electrocardiography (reflecting ventricular repolarization) by approximately the same amount as chloroquine (but by less than quinine) (29, 30). In a study in healthy volunteers, dihydroartemisinin\u2013piperaquine increased the QTc interval by 45.2, 35.5 and 21.0 ms in people who took each dose with a high (~1000 kcal) or low (~400 kcal) fat\/calorie meal and in fasting conditions, respectively; none had a QTc interval greater than 500 ms (2). Significant prolongation of the QTc interval may cause potentially life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia, but there is no evidence that this has occurred with piperaquine, despite its extensive use.      Contraindications      Dihydroartemisinin\u2013piperaquine should not be administered to patients with known hypersensitivity to either dihydroartemisinin or piperaquine (2). It should not be used in patients with congenital QTc prolongation or who have a clinical condition or are on medication that results in QTc interval prolongation.      Cautions      In view of the lack of evidence on the safety of dihydroartemisinin\u2013piperaquine in patients &gt; 70 years of age, in infants weighing &lt; 5 kg and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, patients in these populations should be monitored closely when this combination is administered.      Drug interactions      See Table 5.14.    Dosage recommendations    The previous edition of the\u00a0 WHO Guidelines for the treatment of malaria \u00a0recommended target oral doses of 2\u201310 mg\/kg dihydroartemisinin and 16\u201326 mg\/kg piperaquine to be taken daily for 3 days (1). The dosing schedule recommended by the manufacturers, however, results in some individuals at the upper end of the weight band receiving much lower doses of piperaquine and dihydroartemisinin than this target. Furthermore, the weight-adjusted dosage recommendation for dihydroartemisinin\u2013piperaquine was the same for all age groups, even though their pharmacokinetic parameters do not scale linearly with weight (31). Children aged &lt;5 years have higher body weight-adjusted oral clearance of piperaquine than other age groups (8,14,33) and therefore have lower exposure to piperaquine, placing them at increased risk for treatment failure.  The WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network analysed pooled data from individual patients to determine the influence of dosing schedules on the clinical efficacy of dihydroartemisinin\u2013piperaquine (32). Twenty-four published and two unpublished studies (with a total of 7072 patients) were included in the analysis. After correction for reinfection by parasite genotyping, the Kaplan\u2013Meier estimates of cure rates were high 97.7% (95% CI, 97.3%\u201398.1%) at day 42 and 97.2% (95% CI 96.7%\u201397.7%) at day 63. Overall, 28.6% (979\/3429) of children aged 1\u20135 years received a total dose of piperaquine &lt; 48 mg\/kg (the lower limit previously recommended by WHO), giving a risk that was 2.3\u20132.9-fold greater than that of other age groups. This sub-optimal dosing was associated with higher treatment failure rates at day 63 (94.4%; 95% CI, 92.6\u201396.2%; p &lt; 0.001). After adjustment for confounding factors, the mg\/kg bw dose of piperaquine was found to be a significant predictor of recrudescence, the risk increasing by 13% (95% CI, 5.0\u201321%) for every 5-mg\/kg bw decrease in dose (p = 0.002). In a multivariable model, increasing the target minimum total dose of piperaquine for children aged 1\u20135 years from 48 mg\/kg bw to 59 mg\/kg bw was predicted to halve the risk for treatment failure and was needed to cure more than 95% of these young patients. The increased exposure was not associated with gastrointestinal toxicity in the 10 studies in which this could be assessed.  On the basis of the evidence of sub-optimal dosing of young children, the Mahidol\u2013 Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit performed nonlinear mixed-effects population pharmacokinetics modelling in order to inform WHO dosage recommendations for ensuring equivalent piperaquine exposure for all target populations. Selection of the published models included for simulating the target exposure in adult patients (9, 11, 18) was based on use of an appropriate structural pharmacokinetic model, sufficient data collection and adequate predictive performance. Exposure to piperaquine was then simulated with the population pharmacokinetic estimates and between- and within-patient variation reported for each of the paediatric data sets available (unpublished data from the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network, 8, 19). The results were reported as medians and interquartile ranges for day-7 concentrations. Peak concentrations for 1000 patients were simulated for each body weight. Examples are shown in Figures A5.8.1 and A5.8.2.    Figure A5.8.1. Simulated maximum piperaquine concentrations based on the current recommendations of the manufacturer of Eurartesim\u00ae, the current revised WHO dosing recommendations and population pharmacokinetics reported by Tarning et al. (9). The broken horizontal black lines are the maximum 75th percentile expected after dosing with the manufacturer- recommended dose regimen.                Figure A5.8.2 Simulated day-7 piperaquine capillary plasma concentrations based on the current recommendations of the manufacturer of Eurartesim\u00ae and the current revised WHO dosing recommendations, using population pharmacokinetic parameters reported by Tarning et al. (8). The solid horizontal black lines indicate a previously defined therapeutic day-7 concentration (13).              The revised WHO dosage recommendations selected ensure that the piperaquine exposure of young children (Cmax, day-7 concentration) is equivalent to that of older children and adults, while using as few weight bands as possible and minimizing the use of half-tablets. Equivalent exposure in all weight groups is achievable with increases in mg\/kg bw dosage of up to 20% in those weighing &lt;25kg or &gt;80kg; Importantly, this is not predicted to result in higher maximum (Cmax) or day-7 concentrations of piperaquine than those already observed in adult patients given the doses currently recommmended by the manufacturer. Any further simplification of these recommendations will require a prospective study of the safety of slightly higher mg\/kg doses.    References    1.\u00a0 Guidelines for the treatment of malaria .

It is also used as co- treatment with quinine or artesunate as follow-up treatment for severe malaria or in combination for uncomplicated falciparum malaria.    Structure and mechanism of action    Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic synthetically derived from oxytetracycline, with uses similar to those of tetracycline. It is preferred to tetracycline because of its longer half-life, more reliable absorption and better safety profile in renal insufficiency. It is a slow-acting antimalarial drug that works by inhibiting protein synthesis through disruption of the normal function of the apicoplast in malaria parasites (1, 2).         Molecular mass: 444.4      Pharmacokinetics     The reported pharmacokinetic parameters of doxycycline are summarized in Table A5.9. Doxycycline is highly lipophilic and is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. While the absorption of tetracyclines is known to be affected by the ingestion of food, that of doxycycline is not markedly changed. As milk significantly reduces absorption and the peak plasma concentrations of doxycycline, it should not be administered with milk or other dairy products.  Doxycycline is widely distributed in body fluids and tissues, including bone marrow, breast milk, liver and spleen, and it crosses the placenta. It is approximately 90% bound to plasma proteins. Like other tetracycline compounds, it undergoes enterohepatic recirculation, which slows clearance. Excretion occurs primarily through chelation in the gastrointestinal tract and to a much lesser extent via renal elimination (3\u201322). The elimination half-life of doxycycline is not affected by impaired renal function, renal failure or haemodialysis. Therefore, dose adjustment is not warranted for patients with renal impairment.    Table A5.9. Pharmacokinetic parameters of doxycycline in studies of it\u2019s use for prophylaxis or treatment of malaria (range of mean or median values reported).         In patients with malnutrition, doxycycline clearance is increased and total exposure to the drug is reduced; however, the plasma concentration remains within the therapeutic range (16). Therefore, dose adjustment is not warranted.    Safety         Adverse effects      Doxycycline has side-effects similar to those of other tetracyclines (4). Gastrointestinal effects, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, are common, especially with higher doses, and are due to mucosal irritation. Oral doxycycline should be administered with food if gastrointestinal upset occurs. Dry mouth, glossitis, stomatitis, dysphagia and oesophageal ulceration have also been reported. The incidence of oesophageal irritation can be reduced by administration of doxycycline with a full glass of water.  Tetracyclines, including doxycycline, discolour teeth and cause enamel hypoplasia in young children. Tetracyclines are deposited in deciduous and permanent teeth during their formation and in calcifying areas in bone and nails; they interfere with bone growth in fetuses and young infants.  Other reported side-effects are enterocolitis and inflammatory lesions in the ano-genital region, candidal vaginitis, skin reactions such as maculopapular and erythematous rashes, exfoliative dermatitis and photosensitivity. Patients should be warned to avoid excessive exposure to the sun while taking doxycycline.  Hypersensitivity reactions such as urticaria, angioneurotic oedema, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid purpura, pericarditis and exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus may occur. Severe adverse effects are rare; they include benign intracranial hypertension in adults and haematological abnormalities such as haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and eosinophilia. Thrombophlebitis has been reported with prolonged intravenous administration.      Contraindications      Doxycycline is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to tetracyclines. It is also contraindicated in pregnancy and in children &lt; 8 years (2, 4, 23). Fatal liver necrosis has been reported with doxycycline use in pregnancy. In addition, doxycycline crosses the placenta and may cause discoloration of teeth and possible bone growth retardation in the fetus. Doxycycline use is not advocated for children &lt; 8 years in whom the teeth are still developing because of the possibility of permanent tooth discoloration and bone growth retardation.      Caution      Doxycycline should be used with caution in patients with gastric or intestinal diseases such as colitis, who may be at greater risk for pseudomembranous colitis. Caution is advised in administering doxycycline to patients with established systemic lupus erythematosus, as it might worsen their condition. Drug interactions: See Table 5.14.    References    1.

In combination with artesunate, it is also recommended for treatment of uncomplicated malaria.    Structure and mechanism of action    Mefloquine, a 4-methanolquinoline, is structurally related to quinine and belongs to the aryl amino- alcohol group of drugs (1). Mefloquine has two racemic forms,  erythro - and  threo -, each composed of a pair of enantiomers, of which the racemic mixture of the erythro- enantiomers is the most active against malaria parasites (1). Its mechanism of action is not fully understood but is thought to involve inhibition of parasite-mediated haem detoxification, a common mechanism of action of quinoline antimalarials. A more recent proposal is that it inhibits endocytosis of the cytosol by the parasite (2). Mefloquine has approximately the same stage specificity of action as quinine, killing primarily the large ring and trophozoite asexual parasites. It has no significant pre-erythrocytic activity.         Molecular mass: 378.3      Pharmacokinetics     The pharmacokinetic parameters of mefloquine used with artesunate for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria and for chemoprophylaxis in healthy subjects (3\u201323) are summarised in Table A5.10.    Table A5.10. Pharmacokinetic parameters of mefloquine in studies of currently recommended dosages when used for prophylaxis or treatment of acute malaria (range of mean or median values reported).          Inter-individual differences in absorption result in different times to reach maximum concentrations. The pharmacokinetic parameters of mefloquine are altered in malaria: patients with malaria have higher plasma concentrations and eliminate mefloquine more rapidly than healthy volunteers, possibly because of interruption of entero-hepatic cycling (24). The pharmacokinitic parameters of mefloquine are also highly stereospecific (3\u20135). Mefloquine is extensively distributed in the body; it crosses the blood\u2013brain-barrier and the placenta and is found in breast milk (21). It accumulates in erythrocytes, with an erythrocyte-to-plasma ratio of about 2:1 (24). Approximately 98.2% of mefloquine is bound to protein. In the liver, it is metabolized by CYP3A4, largely to an inactive metabolite (24). Mefloquine has a long elimination half-life (\u2264 3 weeks). Excretion occurs primarily via the bile and faeces as unchanged drug and metabolites, with a small proportion excreted unchanged in the urine.  While mefloquine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of dihydroartemisinin, concomitant administration of artesunate decreases the maximum concentration and increases the clearance rate and volume of distribution of mefloquine (6, 24). Delaying the dose of mefloquine to the second day of artesunate administration increases its estimated oral bioavailability substantially, probably as an indirect effect of rapid clinical improvement (10). Administration with food does not alter the kinetics of artesunate\u2013mefloquine (10, 17).  The pharmacokinitic parameters of mefloquine are similar in children and adults (4, 23). Peak mefloquine concentrations in whole blood are lower during pregnancy than in non-pregnant individuals (8, 21). As the overall efficacy of the drug does not appear to be affected, however, dosage adjustment is not warranted for pregnant women.    Safety         Adverse events       Although mefloquine is associated with higher incidences of central nervous system and gastrointestinal adverse effects than other ACTs, it is generally well tolerated when given in combination with artesunate for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. Mefloquine has been associated with seizures, anxiety, irritability, dizziness, paranoia, suicidal ideation, depression, hallucinations and violence in patients treated for malaria and in people on long-term mefloquine prophylaxis (20, 24\u201331). Such neuropsychiatric adverse effects generally resolve after discontinuation of mefloquine. The estimated incidence of seizures, encephalopathy or psychotic reactions ranges from 1 in 10 000 healthy people receiving chemoprophylaxis, 1 in 1000 malaria patients in Asia, 1 in 200 malaria patients in Africa to 1 in 20 patients recovering from cerebral malaria. Mefloquine should therefore not be given to patients who have had cerebral malaria. Mefloquine prophylaxis should be avoided in travellers who require fine motor coordination or in whom sudden onset of dizziness or confusion may be hazardous, such as pilots and drivers. Travellers and their companions should be advised to monitor for adverse effects such as restlessness, anxiety, depression or confusion, and, if these occur, to discontinue mefloquine and seek medical attention.  The most frequently reported adverse effect with treatment is vomiting or gastrointestinal disturbances, which tend to affect adherence and efficacy. Early vomiting was a predictor of treatment failure in patients given mefloquine for uncomplicated malaria (32). Mefloquine has been associated rarely with hepatitis, polyneuropathy, thrombocytopenia, pneumonia, skin rashes or irritation, sinus bradycardia and visual impairment (33\u201342). Adverse events appear to be associated with high concentrations of the (\u2013)-enantiomer rather than of the drug overall and to be more frequent in women than men (20, 43).      Contraindications       Mefloquine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to mefloquine or related compounds (e.g. quinine and quinidine). It should not be prescribed for follow-up treatment after cerebral malaria or for prophylaxis in patients with active depression, a recent history of depression, generalized anxiety disorder, psychosis, schizophrenia or another major psychiatric disorder, or with epilepsy or a history of convulsions (24).      Caution       Given the lack of evidence on the safety of mefloquine in severe hepatic impairment, such patients should be monitored carefully because of a potential increase in the risk for adverse events. Clinical trials show no or only small, clinically insignificant alterations in the electrocardiogram after administration of mefloquine (39, 44); however, caution should be exrecised in administering mefloquine to patients with cardiac disease. The teratogenic and embryotoxic effects of mefloquine observed in experimental animals and the high rate of spontaneous abortions seen in one small study of mefloquine prophylaxis in pregnant women (45) have raised concern about the safety of mefloquine in pregnancy. Large clinical studies have not, however, revealed such adverse outcomes, allaying concern that mefloquine might be associated with stillbirth (46\u201348). Prophylactic doses of mefloquine in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy also appear to be effective and are not associated with adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (49, 50). However, gastrointestinal side-effects, including nausea and vomiting, are more common in pregnant women treated with mefloquine than those treated with SP (29).      Drug interactions      See Table A5.14.    Dose optimization     For the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in combination with artesunate, the recommended total dose of mefloquine is 25 mg\/kg bw, which gives a higher cure rate than the previously recommended dose of 15 mg\/kg bw. A pharmacokinetics model predicted that initial use of the lower (15-mg\/kg bw) dose of mefloquine resulted in a greater likelihood of selecting resistant mutants than de novo use of the higher (25-mg\/kg bw) dose (51). Giving mefloquine in two or three doses improves its tolerability and oral bioavailability. The fixed-dose combination of artesunate + mefloquine given daily for 3 days is preferred.

Except in primary prophylaxis, primaquine is used in conjunction with an effective blood schizonticide: either ACT, or chloroquine for vivax or ovale malaria.    Structure and mechanism of action     Primaquine is an 8-aminoquinoline, which is highly active against the exoerythrocytic forms (hypnozoites) and the sexual stages of malaria parasites (gametocytes). It has weak activity against the asexual blood stages of P.  vivax  and has negligible activity against P.  falciparum . Although P.  falciparum  gametocyte clearance takes days, gametocytes are sterilized within hours; therefore, the effect of primaquine on oocyst and sporozoite formation (and thus onward transmission of the treated infection) precedes its effect on gametocyte carriage (1).         Molecular mass: 259.4    Hepatic metabolism of primaquine produces reactive intermediate metabolites that generate toxic intracellular oxidative species. The parent compound itself is relatively inactive. The precise mechanism of action of primaquine is not fully understood, but it is thought that the reactive intermediates disrupt the metabolic processes of plasmodial mitochondria and interfere with electron transport in the parasite (2, 3). There is no evidence for acquired resistance to its hypnozoitocidal or gametocytocidal activities.    Pharmacokinetics    Primaquine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, reaching peak concentrations within 1\u20134 h, with a bioavailability of about 96% (4). Primaquine is biotransformed by two main routes: by monoamine oxidase to the predominant, but inactive, metabolite carboxyprimaquine, which is relatively slowly eliminated; and via CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the liver, which generate the reactive intermediates responsible for antimalarial effects and haemolytic toxicity (5\u20137). Genetic polymorphisms that decrease CYP2D6 enzyme activity reduce bioactivation of primaquine and may result in treatment failure. Primaquine is extensively distributed in the body. About 75% of primaquine in plasma is bound to proteins, and high concentrations occur in erythrocytes. Primaquine crosses the placenta, but it is uncertain whether significant amounts occur in breast milk (8).  Both primaquine and carboxyprimaquine are excreted mainly through the biliary tract and can be found in faeces within 24 h of administration (8). Primaquine is also excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Conflicting results have been reported on the effects of gender on the disposition of primaquine, some studies reporting increased exposure and hence greater side-effects in women and others reporting no effect of gender (9\u201311). In view of the relatively small samples in each of these studies, the findings should be interpreted cautiously. The pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of 15 mg did not appear to be altered in patients with severely impaired renal function and end-stage renal dysfunction (12).  The pharmacokinetic parameters of primaquine are summarized in Table A5.11 (4, 7, 9\u201318).    Table A5.11. pharmacokinetic parameters of primaquine and carboxyprimaquine in studies in healthy volunteers and patients (range of mean or median values reported).            Safety         Adverse events       While primaquine is generally well tolerated, it may cause dose-related gastrointestinal discomfort, including abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting (19\u201322). Administration with food improves tolerability. Hypertension and cardiac arrhythmia have been reported rarely. The most important adverse effect is haemolysis in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, and the degree of haemolysis is proportional to the dose, duration of exposure, and degree of G6PD deficiency. Leukopenia, methaemoglobinaemia with cyanosis and granulocytopenia may also occur. Fortunately, primaquine is eliminated rapidly, so that haemolysis stops once the drug is stopped. Patients should discontinue primaquine if they pass red or black urine, or have symptomatic anaemia.      Contraindications       Primaquine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to primaquine or related compounds and in patients with severe G6PD deficiency or severe nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) methaemoglobin reductase deficiency. Primaquine crosses the placenta and may cause haemolysis in a G6PD-deficient fetus; it is therefore not recommended for use during pregnancy or during breastfeeding unless the G6PD status of the infant is known. Use of primaquine in infants &lt; 6 months is not advised because of lack of data on its safety.      Caution      The different variants of G6PD deficiency are associated with significantly different risks for haemolysis. The African A\u2013 variant is at the less severe end of the spectrum of severity, and the Mediterranean variant (which predominates in southern Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia) is at the more severe end (23). Administration of a single dose of 0.25 mg base\/kg bw as a gametocytocide is considered to confer no significant haemolytic risk in people with any of the variants; therefore, testing for GDPD deficiency is not required before this single dose administration. The regimens necessary for radical cure may, however, cause significant, occasionally life-threatening haemolyisis in G6PD-deficient patients; therefore, testing for G6PD deficiency is recommended before radical cure regimens. Unfortunately, testing is not widely available, so an individual decision on whether to prescribe radical a curative regimen depends on an assessment of the potential risks of haemolytic toxicity and the benefits of preventing relapse. This assessment must be based on knowledge of the prevalence and severity of G6PD deficiency in the patient\u2019s ethnic group and the risks and impact of vivax relapse in the area. Caution is also advised in treating patients with systemic diseases associated with an increased risk for granulocytopenia, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.      Drug interactions      See Table A5.14.    Dose optimization     The dosages recommended for radical cure of  P. vivax or P. ovale  malaria, presumptive anti-relapse therapy (0.25 mg base\/kg bw per day for 14 days for \u201ctemperate strain infections\u201d and 0.50 mg base\/kg bw per day for 14 days for tropical, frequently relapsing infections) and primary prophylaxis (0.5 mg\/kg bw base up to maximum oral dose of 30 mg daily) remain unchanged. WHO now recommends a single, low dose (0.25 mg\/kg bw) to reduce onward transmission of  P. falciparum  malaria in programmes to eliminate  P. falciparum  malaria and in areas threatened by resistance of  P. falciparum  to artemisinins (24). This lower dose is safer and was considered to be as effective in reducing transmissibility on the basis of the limited available data from assessments of direct transmission blocking in mosquito feeding studies, which is considered therapeutically more relevant than gametocyte clearance (1, 25\u201327). The feasibility of achieving this lower dosage in young children would be enhanced by the availability of a pre-qualified 3.75-mg primaquine tablet.    References    1. Recht J, Ashley EA, White NJ.

Oral quinine is used in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, particularly in the first trimester of pregnancy, or as an alternative treatment when an effective ACT is not promptly available.    Structure and mechanism of action    Quinine is an alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree that belongs to the aryl amino alcohol group of drugs (1). It is one of four antimalarial cinchona alkaloids and is the L-stereoisomer of quinidine. Quinine kills large ring and trophozoite asexual parasites and is gametocytocidal against  P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae  but not  P. falciparum  malaria (2). The mechanism of action of quinine is not clearly understood, although it is thought to involve inhibition of parasite haem detoxification inside the food vacuole.         Pharmacokinetics     The pharmacokinetic parameters of quinine are presented in Table A5.12 (2\u201333). Quinine is rapidly absorbed after both oral and parenteral administration. It is widely distributed throughout the body and is detectable in cerebrospinal fluid, breast milk and the placenta (2). Quinine undergoes extensive hepatic biotransformation, predominantly via CYP3A4 enzymes as well as CYP2C9, CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, into several metabolites. Quinine is both a substrate and an inhibitor of CYP2D6. The initial metabolite, 3-hydroxyquinine, contributes approximately 10% of the antimalarial activity of the parent compound. Up to 20% of administered drug is excreted unchanged by the kidneys, and small amounts may appear in bile and saliva (34, 35).    Table A5.12. Pharmacokinetic parameters of quinine reported with currently recommended doses used for the treatment of patients with severe or uncomplicated malaria (range of mean or median values reported).          The pharmacokinetics of quinine is altered significantly by malaria infection (2\u20134). Both the apparent volume of distribution and systemic clearance are reduced in proportion to disease severity, resulting in higher plasma quinine levels in patients with severe malaria. As a result, quinine accumulates with standard maintenance dosing regimens (10 mg salt\/kg bw every 8 h), unless the patient starts to recover. As a consequence, if there is no clinical recovery within 48 h, the dosage is reduced by one third (to 10 mg salt\/kg bw every 12 h). In patients who are in acute renal failure, quinine clearance is determined by the overall disease severity and hepatic function. In addition, plasma-protein binding, mainly to the acute-phase protein \u03b11-acid glycoprotein, increases from about 80% in healthy subjects to around 90% in patients with malaria (36).  The exposure of pregnant women to quinine was generally lower and elimination more rapid than that in non-pregnant patients (23, 28). The disposition of quinine changes with age, with slightly higher concentrations observed in children &lt; 2 years (24). In children with protein energy malnutrition, clearance is significantly reduced, the elimination half-life is significantly longer but the maximum concentration significantly lower than in controls (20, 31, 32). Quinine pharmacokinetics, including total clearance normalized to ideal body weight, is not significantly altered in obese patients; thus, the maintenance dose of quinine in these patients should be based on ideal body weight rather than on total body weight (6, 33). Quinine clearance is significantly lower in elderly patients, posing a potential risk for drug accumulation and toxicity (26).    Safety         Adverse events      Because of its narrow therapeutic index, quinine has frequent adverse effects (2, 6, 8, 28, 37). The side-effects commonly seen after administration of treatment doses are referred to as \u201ccinchonism\u201d. Mild forms are characterized by tinnitus, slight impairment of hearing, headache, nausea, dizziness, dysphoria and sometimes disturbed vision. Impairment of high tone hearing is usually concentration- dependent and reversible. More severe manifestations include vertigo, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, marked auditory loss and visual symptoms, including loss of vision. An important side-effect of quinine is hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia, which is particularly common in young children, pregnant women and elderly patients. Quinine also causes prolongation of the QTc interval (typically by about 10%), although cardiotoxic effects are much less frequent than those of quinidine. Hypotension and cardiac arrest may occur if the drug is given too rapidly (such as in an intravenous bolus); intravenous formulations should therefore be given by infusion not exceeding a rate of 5 mg\/kg bw per hour. Venous thrombosis may occur after intravenous administration, while pain, necrosis and abscess formation may occur with acidic intramuscular injections. Hypersensitivity reactions to quinine have also been reported, including urticaria, bronchospasm, flushing of the skin, fever, antibody-mediated thrombocytopenia, haemolytic anaemia and haemolytic\u2013uraemic syndrome. Hepatic injury and psychosis occur very rarely.  Quinine has been used as an abortifacient, but there is no evidence that it causes abortion, premature labour or fetal abnormalities (28, 34). Quinine therefore remains the drug of choice during the first trimester of pregnancy. It may also be used safely in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, although poor compliance because of 7-day treatment course and low tolerability may compromise its efficacy, and there is a high rate of hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia.  Overdosage of quinine may cause oculotoxicity, including blindness from direct retinal toxicity, and cardiotoxicity, and can be fatal (38). Cardiotoxic effects include conduction disturbances, angina and hypotension leading to cardiac arrest. Treatment is largely supportive, with particular attention to maintenance of blood pressure, glucose and renal function and to treating any arrhythmias.      Contraindications      Quinine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to quinine or any of the cinchona alkaloids.      Caution       Although caution should be exercised when administering quinine to patients who have heart rhythm disorders or heart disease, there is little evidence of cardiotoxicity in patients with malaria. Quinine metabolites may cause oxidative haemolysis in people with G6PD deficiency. Caution is also advised in treating patients with kidney or liver disease, as the drug may accumulate (10, 18, 19, 39\u201341).      Drug interactions       See Table A5.14.    References    1.

SP is used in combination with amodiaquine for seasonal malaria chemoprevention in children in areas with highly seasonal malaria transmission, and, in the few areas in which it remains effective, SP can be used with artesunate for the treatment of acute uncomplicated malaria.    Structure and mechanism of action     Sulfadoxine is a sulfonamide antimicrobial, which acts by inhibiting the activity of dihydropteroate synthetase and thus synthesis of folic acid by bacteria and protozoa. Sulfadoxine is active predominantly against the later development stages of asexual parasites (1).         Molecular mass: 310.3    Pyrimethamine inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and thereby the synthesis of folic acid by protozoa. It is again active predominantly against the later development stages of asexual parasites (1).    Seasonal malaria chemoprevention  (see  section 11.3 ) with SP + amodiaquine should not be implemented in areas with high levels of resistance to SP or amodiaquine (2).      Molecular mass: 248.7      Intermittent preventive treatment  (see  sections 11.1  and  11.2 ): In areas with moderate levels of resistance to SP, intermittent preventive treatment remains effective in both pregnant women and infants, but the effectiveness decreases with high levels of resistance (3\u20138). The greatest protection in pregnancy is achieved by use of insecticide-treated nets in combination with an effective regimen of intermittent preventive treatment (9, 10). Adequate, consistent use if nets and other preventive measures is particularly important in areas where resistance to SP and malaria transmission intensity are high. Artesunate + SP should not be used for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in areas with established SP resistance. Some studies have indicated an increase in gametocyte carriage at low levels of resistance, further compromising the useful therapeutic life of this antimalarial drug (11\u201313)    Pharmacokinetics     The pharmacokinetic parameters of sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine are presented in Table A5.13. Both sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. Plasma protein binding is about 90% for both drugs. Sulfadoxine usually, but not always, has a longer elimination half-life than pyrimethamine. Pyrimethamine has a larger volume of distribution than sulfadoxine and is concentrated in kidneys, lungs, liver and spleen. Like sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine crosses the placental barrier and passes into breast milk. Sulfadoxine is metabolized mainly by the liver, undergoing varying degrees of acetylation, hydroxylation and glucuronidation. Pyrimethamine is also metabolized in the liver and, like sulfadoxine, is excreted mainly through the kidneys. The renal clearance of sulfadoxine is reported to vary with pH: a decrease in urinary pH from 7.5 to 5.5 decreased renal clearance by a factor of 2 (1, 14\u201325).    Table A5.13. pharmacokinetic parameters of sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine in studies of currently recommended dosages for the treatment, seasonal chemoprevention or intermittent preventive treatment of malaria (range of mean or median values reported).          The interaction between artesunate and SP has been investigated (24, 25). Although the volume of distribution of pyrimethamine increased slightly on co-administration with artesunate, this is unlikely to be clinically significant, as total exposure and concentrations up to day 7 were not affected (25).    Safety         Adverse events       At the recommended doses, SP is generally well tolerated. The adverse effects reported are mainly those associated with sulfonamides, including gastrointestinal disturbances, headache, dizziness and skin reactions such as photosensitivity, rash, pruritus, urticaria and slight hair loss (1, 26\u201329). Potentially fatal skin reactions, namely erythema multiforme, Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, may also occur (1). Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, megaloblastic anaemia, haemolytic anaemia (probably related to G6PD deficiency), crystalluria, haematuria, oliguria and hepatitis have also been reported. There have been isolated case reports of serum sickness, allergic pericarditis and pulmonary infiltrates resembling eosinophilic or allergic alveolitis.      Contraindications      SP, alone or in combination with amodiaquine or artesunate, is contraindicated in:    individuals with known hypersensitivity to pyrimethamine, sulfonamides and related compounds; \t patients with documented megaloblastic anaemia due to folate deficiency; \t premature or newborn infants in the first 2 months of life, because of the immaturity of their enzyme systems; and \t HIV-infected patients receiving cotrimoxazole prophylaxis against opportunistic infections.        Caution      If skin eruptions, cytopenia or a bacterial or fungal super-infection occurs, use of SP should be discontinued. Caution is advised in repeated administration of SP to patients with blood dyscrasias and those with renal or hepatic failure, in whom the drugs accumulate.    Drug interactions    See Table 5.14.    Dose optimization     Dosing of antimalarial medicines has often been based on age, because access to formal health services or functioning weighing scales is often limited in malaria- endemic countries. While age-based dosing is more practical, it could result in under- or over-dosing in more patients. The accuracy of age-based dosing of SP could be improved by collating data on weight-for-age for each malaria-endemic region, as has been done for sub-Saharan African children in relation to administration of artesunate + amodiaquine (30).

Knowledge of resistance mechanisms is important for understanding cross-resistance, which can occur even between insecticide classes with different modes of action due to target-site, metabolic or cuticular mechanisms. Understanding intensity of resistance and the mechanism involved is essential for making operational decisions, such as the choice of an alternative insecticide for IRS and rotation of insecticides with different modes of action for resistance management.

Principles and practice of malaria elimination  This section gives an overview of the principles of malaria elimination, from the moment a country decides to set elimination targets to the point at which the country is certified malaria-free by WHO. These principles are summarized in  Box 2  and further detailed in subsequent sections.    BOX 2.     Key principles of malaria elimination       National malaria elimination is defined as country-wide interruption of local mosquito-borne transmission of a specified malaria parasite species (reduction to zero incidence of indigenous cases). \t WHO certification of malaria elimination in a country requires proof that local transmission of all human malaria parasites has been interrupted, resulting in zero incidence of indigenous cases for at least the past three consecutive years. Measures to prevent re-establishment of transmission are required indefinitely until eradication is achieved. \t No single intervention or package of interventions will achieve malaria elimination in all countries; rather, a set of interventions should be identified and used appropriately for the malaria transmission intensity and dynamics in each country to achieve and maintain elimination. Because of variation in the effectiveness of interventions by place and time, effectiveness should be evaluated regularly to guide adaptation of the country\u2019s malaria programme. \t Excellent surveillance and response are the keys to achieving and maintaining malaria elimination; information systems must become increasingly \u201cgranular\u201d to allow identification, tracking, classification and response for all malaria cases (e.g. imported, introduced, indigenous). \t Elimination requires that the health system in a country have both strong leadership and the capacity to reach fully into communities (e.g. with systems to ensure access, deliver quality services, track progress and rapidly and effectively respond to epidemiological challenges). \t Operational research on tools, strategies and delivery should generate knowledge to improve guidelines and future elimination activities. \t Every country, including those with a high burden of malaria, may consider malaria elimination as a goal and adjust interventions to accelerate progress towards elimination. Therefore, understanding of the process and requirements for WHO certification of malaria elimination should be global. \t Any country may set subnational elimination targets as internal milestones to maintain public and political commitment and to increase the funding available for attaining national certification.        As further discussed in    section 5   , malaria elimination in a country is officially recognized by WHO certification. In order to be certified malaria-free, a country must show beyond reasonable doubt that local malaria transmission has ended in the country, resulting in zero incidence of indigenous malaria cases for at least the past three consecutive years. This requires that a good-quality surveillance and response system is in place for rapid detection, diagnosis and treatment of any case of locally transmitted malaria. It is essential that countries embarking on malaria elimination establish such systems early in the programme so that they can achieve and maintain their status. Countries should be aware of the requirements for documentation of proof of malaria elimination to be certified as malaria-free.  A country that plans to set subnational elimination targets should establish internal systems to verify malaria-free areas within its borders (see    section 5   ). Subnational verification is conducted by countries, including evaluation of candidate subnational areas. Subnational verification not only contributes to strengthening surveillance and response but also provides opportunities for attaining milestones as the country progresses towards elimination, reinforcing national commitment and advocacy for continued or additional funding."},{"nid":597,"text_data":"3. Management and planning  Eliminating malaria requires a well-trained workforce, engagement in multiple sectors, strong community involvement and commitment at the highest levels of leadership. An elimination programme is not an intensified version of the approach of \u201cscaling up for impact\u201d. Deployment of interventions becomes more complex, and programmes must increase their understanding of the biological, environmental and social determinants of malaria transmission in order to plan and determine the best mix of interventions for specific areas. Considerations for managing and planning an elimination programme are listed in  Box 5.   \u00a0    BOX 5.     Management and planning: key points       Planning for elimination should begin with an assessment of the epidemiological, operational, and financial situation of the malaria programme. \t Several plans should be made: strategic, elimination, operational and monitoring and evaluation. \t Strategic plans should be costed to inform and facilitate resource mobilization. \t Elimination programmes must constantly monitor critical metrics, regularly validate and analyse the collected data and adjust programmes in response. \t Elimination programmes require strong management and structures that encourage hiring, training and retention of staff with core skills and reliable supply chains. \t Establishment of an independent national malaria elimination advisory committee is recommended to provide an external view of progress and any gaps. \t Elimination programmes benefit from a supportive enabling environment, which can consist of political commitment from national leaders, the enactment of necessary legislation, strategic partnerships across sectors and community engagement."},{"nid":598,"text_data":"4. Prevention of re-establishment of malaria  The consequences of importation of malaria to malaria-free countries or areas are mainly clinical (uncomplicated to severe illness, death and disability) but also epidemiological (potentially resulting in introduced and indigenous cases) and economic (work days lost to the disease and costs of malaria control activities). Means for preventing the re-establishment of malaria are summarized in  Box 6 .    BOX 6. Prevention of the re-establishment of malaria: key points       Re-establishment of transmission is defined as the occurrence of three or more indigenous malaria cases of the same species per year in the same focus for three consecutive years. \t After malaria has been eliminated, a programme for the prevention of reestablishment should continue until malaria eradication, defined as complete interruption of transmission of all forms of human malaria throughout the world, is achieved. \t Preventing the re-establishment of malaria transmission requires proper management of  receptivity  (the ability of an ecosystem to allow transmission of malaria) and  vulnerability  (the probability of malaria parasite importation into a country or area). \t In order to manage the risk for re-establishment of malaria transmission effectively, a high-performing health system should be maintained to ensure early detection, mandatory notification and prompt treatment of all malaria cases; determination of the probable causes of re-establishment; immediate action in the event that local malaria transmission is detected; and measurement of the risk for malaria re-establishment by monitoring of receptivity and vulnerability. \t Once malaria has been eliminated from a country or area, political and financial commitment at national and subnational levels should be sustained. \t Once malaria elimination has been achieved, the malaria programme should be integrated into public health programmes in order to maintain the necessary technical expertise, even if the responsible staff no longer work solely on malaria.        Countries or areas that have eliminated malaria should have a plan for preventing reestablishment of transmission when indigenous malaria cases are no longer observed but imported and introduced cases may continue to be reported. This is also important for countries and areas that are aiming for or have achieved WHO certification or subnational verification of malaria elimination, as described in    section 5.        Fig. 8  depicts the differences between imported, introduced and indigenous cases and the notion of re-establishment of transmission.    FIG. 8. Imported, introduced and indigenous cases and the notion of re-establishment of transmission   \u00a0This figure depicts a locality within a malaria-free area or country in which malaria is diagnosed in an individual who recently travelled to a malaria-endemic area or country (imported case). F1 and F2 are, respectively, introduced and indigenous cases (both by local transmission). While malaria reintroduction is the occurrence of introduced cases (cases of first-generation [F1] local transmission, epidemiologically linked to a confirmed imported case) in a previously malaria-free country or area, re-establishment of transmission is the occurrence of three or more indigenous malaria cases of the same species per year in the same focus for three consecutive years.      After malaria has been eliminated, prevention of re-establishment should continue until malaria eradication is achieved. As achieving malaria elimination relies on strong systems, it is expected that elimination will be durable or \u201csticky\u201d    (41)   ."},{"nid":599,"text_data":"5. Certification and verification of malaria elimination  This section presents the prerequisites and process for WHO certification of national malaria elimination; it also describes the new concept of verifying subnational malaria elimination, a country-owned, step-wise process for documenting elimination of local transmission of malaria in a province, region, island or other subnational area. The latter undertaking is an option for large countries that have achieved interruption of local transmission in certain states, regions or provinces and will contribute to the detailed documentation required for WHO certification of national malaria elimination.

Steady improvements in the quality, timeliness and use of surveillance information must begin early in malaria programmes to ensure that elimination work is well directed and monitored. Ultimately, surveillance will become part of the intervention, focused on case characterization, treatment and investigation and on identification, management and clearance of transmission foci.  Malaria surveillance systems are described extensively in operational manuals on malaria elimination    (32)    and malaria control    (33)    issued by WHO. Both manuals will be revised in 2017; see the WHO GMP website for updated information. \u00a0\u00b9\u00b9\u00a0Monitoring of vectors and vector control is also important and is described in  section 2.3.5 ; this section addresses malaria infections in humans."},{"nid":613,"text_data":"2.6.3 Case characterization, classification, follow-up and response  Each parasitologically confirmed malaria case should be evaluated. A case investigation form is completed for each confirmed malaria case (see example in    Annex 7   ), which includes characterization of the case: patient demographics, history of the current illness, including diagnostic test results and treatment, as well as travel history to assess how and where the infection might have been acquired and the possibility of onward transmission.  After a case has been characterized, it should be classified as imported, introduced, indigenous, relapsing, recrudescent or induced, according to the definitions given in the  Glossary  (see also  Fig. 8  in    section 4   ). Correct epidemiological classification of malaria cases is the basis for selecting appropriate measures and classifying foci (see    section 2.6.4   ).  Classification is based on the case characterization and understanding of the different intervals in the life cycle of malaria parasites (see  Table A1  in    Annex 1   ). Especially for cases detected by ACD, the final classification depends on data on previous cases in the same locality and a focus investigation. If, for example, the case history is compatible with both importation and local transmission, the presence or absence of other locally acquired cases may determine the classification. Staff responsible for case classification should be trained in classification and investigation during field exercises and by reviewing case histories. After a case has been characterized, the response should be based on the classification, although all cases should be managed according to national treatment guidelines. Additional responses to address transmission for the different classifications are described below."},{"nid":614,"text_data":"2.6.4 Focus identification, characterization, classification and follow-up  \u201cFocus\u201d is defined in the  Glossary . It should be noted that a focus may not necessarily have active transmission; foci can be identified only in receptive areas. As discussed in    section 2.2   , foci are described and delimited in order to identify areas in which appropriate interventions should be deployed or maintained. As described below, a focus investigation is conducted to determine the response measures necessary to eliminate or prevent re-establishment of transmission.  A focus may be identified in several ways. For example, the investigation of an individual case may lead to the recognition of additional locally transmitted cases around the case household, and further investigation shows that transmission is limited to a geographically defined area. Active investigation of areas previously defined as \u201cat risk\u201d may identify a transmission focus.  Once a focus has been identified, an investigation is launched to delimit and characterize the area and the populations at risk, and a focus investigation form is completed (see example in    Annex 8   ). The investigation is more extensive for a new focus, whereas detection of a new case in known active foci will trigger a new focus investigation only if its features (e.g. parasite species or location) differ from those of previously detected cases. The area to be covered is determined by an initial rapid assessment based on the results of ACD and entomological and community social and behavioural investigations. The focus investigation will then identify the main features of the location, including populations at risk, location of actual or potential breeding sites, likely vectors and, if possible, insecticide susceptibility and behaviour. The findings may lead to modification of the initial mapping until a clear, stable picture emerges.  A map should be prepared of the location of case households, geographical features relevant for malaria transmission (e.g. water bodies, forests and altitude), other habitations, health facilities and roads, as well as coverage of all interventions.

Countries, subnational areas and communities are at different stages in malaria elimination; their rate of progress depends on their level of investment, biological determinants (of the affected population, the parasites and the vectors), environmental factors, the strength and performance of the health system and social, demographic, political and economic realities. Thus, the time that each country will take to reach elimination depends strongly on contextual factors. Probably the two most important factors that can be acted upon are a political decision to accelerate activities and ownership and the performance of the national health system and its adaptability to new opportunities. If these two factors are in place, the time a country takes to achieve elimination depends on effective universal health coverage with the core malaria interventions (pillar 1 of the GTS) and an effective health management andinformation system that allows national malaria control programmes to direct resources, identify gaps in coverage, detect outbreaks and assess the impact of interventions (pillar 3 of the GTS). It is through these approaches that countries such as Sri Lanka have achieved elimination, and often accelerated it."},{"nid":616,"text_data":"3.1 Planning process  Planning for elimination should be linked with national and local planning. It should begin with an assessment of the epidemiological, operational and financial situation of the malaria programme, including what is currently working well and any gaps and challenges.    The epidemiological assessment  addresses the current malaria situation and stratification (see    section 2.2 ),  including trends over time and the tools that have most influenced them. The assessment should also characterize the affected populations and seek to determine the economic, social and behavioural dynamics that affect disease transmission. It should also confirm and evaluate the effectiveness and cost\u2013effectiveness of malaria control interventions. The effectiveness of the programme can be evaluated in epidemiological surveys and\/or in studies of the efficacy of medicines or insecticides.  The purpose of an  operational assessment  is to identify gaps in programmes and what should be strengthened to achieve the desired objectives within the given timeframe. It includes structure, staffing and achievements as well as weaknesses that might prevent achievement of the objectives.  The  financial assessment  should involve a costing of malaria programmes and a review of the funding situation, both current and anticipated.

Processes should be set up to validate the collected data regularly, analyse it and adjust programmes in response.  Leaders at all levels of the malaria programme should be empowered to collect and analyse data regularly. Centrally, programme managers require information on overall performance to track progress and report to their government and donors; they also require measures of the availability of commodities to ensure timely distribution of pharmaceutical products and avoid stock-outs. At provincial level, malaria managers require analysis of intervention coverage in order to hold implementers accountable, adjust strategies to cover underserved areas and evaluate the effectiveness of tools. Individual health facilities should receive feedback on their testing and reporting rates and how they compare with those elsewhere. All staff should be trained in recognizing the importance of data, and the results of analyses should be shared with the people who collected the data in order to demonstrate its value."},{"nid":618,"text_data":"3.3 Programme structure and management  The structure of a malaria programme varies from country to country; however, all programmes require a central structure to provide technical leadership, set policies and guidelines, coordinate national training, communicate with donors and evaluate overall progress.

If milestones are not met, processes must exist for detecting and responding to challenges and ensuring that similar problems do not occur again. If operations are conducted by provincial programmes, a system should be in place to ensure that they are aligned with the national strategy and well coordinated by the central leadership.

Drug resistance is only one of several factors that may cause treatment failure. Although a TES can help to predict the likelihood of resistance to an antimalarial drug, confirmation and characterization of parasite resistance require additional tools (e.g. in-vitro or ex-vivo tests, analysis of molecular markers and measurement of drug concentrations in the blood), for which WHO standard protocols are available    (27) ."},{"nid":630,"text_data":"4.4 Monitoring the efficacy of antimalarial drugs in settings with very low transmission  In areas of very low transmission, it may be impossible to accrue the number of patients required for a TES.

While the effectiveness of both these interventions is maximal with high coverage and use, their impact is temporary and depends on their maintenance. Premature withdrawal of ITNs\/LLINs and IRS can result in a rebound of malaria transmission to pre-existing levels (see    section 2.3.4   ).  Optimal coverage of ITNs\/LLINs or IRS should be maintained in strata that are both receptive and vulnerable to malaria transmission. The receptivity of an area is not static but is affected by determinants such as environmental and climate factors. The many anopheline vectors around the world differ in the efficiency with which they transmit malaria. Thus, some, such as the nocturnal indoor-biting and indoorresting mosquitoes in sub-Saharan Africa, are more amenable to control by indoor interventions. Earlier and\/or outdoor biting and resting anophelines in other continents may be less so, although some will enter houses and be killed by the interventions.

Members of the panel evaluate whether the following prerequisites have been satisfactorily fulfilled:    a malaria surveillance system of high quality covering all the geographical areas of the country; \t evidence of no indigenous malaria cases for the past three years (based on comprehensive case investigation forms); \t an adequate system for early detection and effective treatment of malaria cases and for subsequent clinical and epidemiological monitoring, supported by continuing education on malaria for health workers, including in the private sector; \t laboratory services that provide prompt, quality-assured parasitological diagnosis of malaria throughout the country, including the most remote and inaccessible areas; \t prompt, thorough epidemiological investigation and classification of every malaria case and focus; \t immediate mandatory notification of all malaria cases by public and private health services; \t a central computerized database of malaria cases and foci, with a geographical information system for mapping, and a national register of cases; and \t a comprehensive national plan of action with continuing political and financial support for activities to prevent re-establishment of local transmission.    Special studies (for instance, molecular epidemiological studies by polymerase chain reaction techniques to map the distribution of sub-microscopic infections) may provide additional proof that malaria transmission has been interrupted.  The prerequisites for preventing re-establishment of malaria transmission are:    an adequate system for early recognition and rapid response to malaria epidemics; \t inter-country information-sharing and functional border coordination, where relevant; \t an efficient malaria surveillance system (which may be integrated into systems for other communicable diseases); \t effective mechanisms for cooperation among all ministries and agencies involved in malaria prevention; \t a high-quality system for entomological surveillance, including monitoring of resistance of malaria vectors to insecticides, especially in areas with high receptivity; and \t services to raise awareness and provide practical advice on prevention and early detection of imported malaria (for nationals travelling to or returning from malaria-endemic countries).    During the field visit, MECP members review the quality and completeness of the database. The data are cross-checked against the information provided in the national elimination report. Attention is paid to the classification of individual cases and foci. MECP members pay particular attention to:    coverage of populations by health services that provide access to malaria diagnosis and treatment, especially in former transmission foci and other entomologically receptive areas; \t the possible presence, in areas at risk for malaria, of treatment sites that do not always report cases to the surveillance system, including private pharmacies, private medical practitioners, drug vendors, public and private hospitals that were not included in the malaria surveillance system, military health services and services in neighbouring countries; \t documentation of surveillance at intermediate and primary levels, including case and focus registers, entomological surveillance reports and mapping of breeding sites in receptive foci; \t validation of surveillance reports against health facility records and anti-malarial drug supply figures; \t surveillance of populations at risk for malaria in time and space, based on a matrix showing the sizes of the smallest population units and the number of diagnostic tests (blood slides and\/or RDTs) conducted in each of the units by month during the transmission season; \t the existence and performance of or requirement for special measures to ensure coverage of mobile populations, including temporary workers, illegal immigrants and refugees, whose presence and distribution in an administrative unit is variable or uncertain and who may not habitually use established health services; \t standard operating procedures for quality-assured diagnostic methods (RDTs and microscopy); an internationally certified, designated national central reference laboratory; and a national quality assurance system for malaria diagnosis reports; \t the timeliness of diagnosis and treatment specifically for malaria; and \t the timeliness of notification, epidemiological investigation of cases and foci and reporting.    MECP members also assess whether the systems and activities of the national programme can be considered adequate to monitor the potential for re-establishment of malaria into the country, to identify the areas that are receptive to resumption of transmission, to identify areas that are likely to become receptive, to identify areas vulnerable to parasitic importation and capture changes in vulnerability, and to take adequate measures to prevent re-establishment of transmission."},{"nid":644,"text_data":"Operational research  National operational research is essential for evaluating the operational feasibility, safety and cost\u2013effectiveness of potential wide-scale use of new tools and strategies.

These are the product of careful evaluation following standardized methods as part of the  WHO normative processes      [1]   . WHO uses strictly defined processes to assess the quality, consistency and completeness of evidence to determine the strength of each recommendation.  WHO malaria recommendations tend to be short, evidence-based statements. They are usually accompanied by supplementary statements which draw attention to contextual and implementation considerations that may influence the appropriateness and impact of a recommendation in different settings. Clearly distinguishing recommendations from their associated contextual considerations provides a degree of flexibility for national policy makers to adopt and adapt the strategies that are most appropriate in their settings. \u00a0 This online platform and the associated PDF help to distinguish the formal recommendations from the supplementary statements. The Global Malaria Programme (GMP) will use this platform to produce \u201cliving guidelines\u201d which can be updated more rapidly than printed documents as new evidence becomes available. The tabs below each recommendation enable users to access the research evidence and evidence to decision frameworks (EtD) that informed the recommendation. There is also a feedback tab where users are encouraged to provide input directly related to each intervention. The online platform contains links to other resources including guidance and information on: strategic use of information to drive impact; surveillance, monitoring and evaluation; \u00a0operational manuals handbooks, and frameworks; and a glossary of terms and definitions. \u00a0   WHO guidelines, recommendations and good practice statements   A WHO guideline is any document developed by WHO containing recommendations for clinical practice or public health policy. A recommendation informs the intended end-user what he or she can or should do in specific situations to achieve the best possible health outcomes, individually or collectively. It guides the choice among different interventions or measures to ensure a positive impact on health and implications for the use of resources. \u00a0 In certain situations, good practice statements may be provided. These statements reflect the consensus of the Guidelines Development Group (GDG) that the benefits of adhering to the statement are large and unequivocal, and do not need to be supported by a systematic evidence review. \u00a0 The primary purpose of these WHO Guidelines is to support policy-makers in ministries of health and the managers of national malaria control programmes in endemic countries to establish national policies and plans tailored to their local context.     Link to WHO prequalification   When a recommendation is linked to the introduction of a new tool or product, there is a parallel process managed by the WHO Prequalification Team to ensure that diagnostics, medicines, vaccines and vector control products meet global standards of quality, safety and efficacy, in order to optimize use of health resources and improve health outcomes. The prequalification process consists of a transparent, scientifically sound assessment, including dossier review, consistency testing or performance evaluation and site visits to manufacturers. This information, in conjunction with other procurement criteria, is used by the United Nations (UN) and other procurement agencies in make purchasing decisions regarding these health products. This parallel process aims to ensure that recommendations are linked to prequalified products and that prequalified products are linked to a recommendation for use.     Use of strategic information to drive impact   Clear evidence-informed recommendations are a critical component to support the development of national malaria strategic plans; they are intended to communicate \u201cwhat to do\u201d. A second critical element is the strategic use of local data. This informs an understanding of the contextual diversity within each malaria-endemic country. Local data provide an understanding of the different types of settings \u2013 or strata \u2013 within each country. This is an essential prerequisite to identify the optimal mix of interventions and the best means to deliver them in the different subnational strata. \u00a0 GMP is working with countries to strengthen the use of local information for stratification, the definition of optimal mixes of interventions, and the rational, safe and ethical prioritization of resources\u00a0to maximize impact. Local data are also essential to understand the impact of the strategies deployed, providing opportunities to further refine sub-national strategies and inform global knowledge. \u00a0 WHO also develops implementation guidance such as operational and field manuals to support the \u201chow\u201d aspect of delivering the recommended tools and strategies. Operational manuals and other guidance hold practical information for increasing the target population's access to interventions and are linked to these Guidelines. GMP is working to align this implementation guidance with the recommendations in the\u00a0 WHO Guidelines for malaria . However, where there are inconsistencies, the Guidelines should be the default resource for national decisions. Countries may use the implementation guidance to define ways in which a recommendation can be implemented effectively \u2013 for example, intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in pregnancy could be implemented through antenatal care and\/or community distribution. The intention of the guidance is to enable delivery, not to prescribe exactly how it should be done. \u00a0   Evidence base   These Guidelines are based on the synthesis of the available evidence on the health effects of interventions, and the grading of the certainty of that evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. The synthesized and graded evidence on the health effects of interventions, as well as any evidence on contextual factors, is used to develop an evidence to decision (EtD) framework for each recommendation\u00a0   [2]   . The judgement of the different factors in the EtD framework (including the certainty of evidence) facilitates the determination of the strength and direction of each recommendation.   Expert input is important for the interpretation of the evidence, and the development of guidance may rely on expert opinion, particularly in areas where the evidence is currently weak, scarce or absent. For example, the vector control recommendations presented in the Guidelines are based on a consideration of the evidence gained from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and other types of trials and studies, as well as the technical knowledge and experience of the GDG and External Review Group involved in the standard guideline development process. Details of how evidence is considered are presented in  Section 8 : Methods. Details of contributors for specific Guidelines are presented in  Section 10 : Contributors and interests.    Updating evidence-based guidance   The first edition of these consolidated Guidelines was released in early 2021 as a compilation of the existing recommendations. The first update of the Guidelines was informed by new evidence syntheses which, where appropriate, led to updates to existing recommendations or to the formulation of new ones.\u00a0  This update incorporates updates to the vector control guidance in the malaria prevention section. The following changes were made:    Based on a recently completed systematic review of the impact of larval habitat modification and\/or manipulation against malaria, it was determined that the evidence base for either of these interventions is currently insufficient to make a recommendation. This assessment and identification of evidence gaps requiring further data generation have been made explicit; \t A conditional recommendation for house screening was developed based on a recently completed systematic review on housing modifications; \t Background information was added on how insecticide treated nets (ITNs) elicit protection for both the individual users and for the community (net users and non) where nets are widely used. This additional information drew upon a recent review of studies describing the biological mechanisms of how ITNs function with a focus on the \u2018community effect\u2019. \t The sections on insecticide resistance management and insecticide selection were updated to make it clearer that data from insecticide resistance assays should not be used to select between different pyrethroid products; \t Estimates of the resources needed for WHO recommended interventions have been added to inform local costing studies as a first step to provide cost-effectiveness estimates and guide the selection of intervention packages; and \t Areas where evidence gaps remain and research is needed to inform further revisions of the guidance for malaria vector control have been updated. \t\u00a0    Readers should note the dates of individual recommendations. Revisions to this guidance will be communicated via the GMP website and through WHO\u2019s standard dissemination channels. From this point forward, these consolidated Guidelines represent the latest and definitive reference for all WHO guidance on malaria.    Dissemination   These consolidated\u00a0 WHO Guidelines for malaria\u00a0 are available on the MAGICapp online platform, linked to the\u00a0 WHO malaria website . The original English version will be translated into three languages (French, Spanish and Arabic).\u00a0All research evidence and references are available on the web platform and will be available to download, and relevant implementation guidance will be linked to the recommendations. \u00a0When recommendations are updated, they will be labelled as such and will always display the date of the most recent update. Each time there is an update, an updated PDF version of the Guidelines will be downloadable on the WHO GMP website to facilitate access where the Internet is not reliably available. Users should note that older downloaded PDFs of the Guidelines may be outdated and may not contain the latest recommendations.   WHO Headquarters will work closely with its regional and country offices to ensure the wide dissemination of the Guidelines to all malaria endemic countries. There will also be dissemination through regional, sub-regional and country meetings.\u00a0Member States will be supported to adapt and implement these Guidelines.    Feedback    GMP welcomes feedback, either via the tab associated with each recommendation or by e-mail to  gmpfeedback@who.int , to help identify recommendations in need of update or development."},{"nid":697,"text_data":"2 Introduction    Background   Malaria continues to cause unacceptably high levels of disease and death, as documented in successive editions of the\u00a0   World malaria report \u00a0      [3]   . According to the latest report, there were an estimated 229 million\u00a0cases and 409 000 deaths globally in 2019. Malaria is preventable and treatable, and the global priority is to reduce the burden of disease and death while retaining the long-term vision of malaria eradication. Here we present the\u00a0 WHO Guidelines for malaria \u00a0developed by the WHO Global Malaria Programme (GMP) as a comprehensive and inclusive resource for advice on malaria.  The\u00a0   Global technical strategy for malaria 2016\u20132030\u00a0       [4]   \u00a0(GTS) provides an overarching framework to guide malaria control and elimination efforts. Adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2015, the Strategy defines goals, milestones and targets on the path to a world free of malaria (Table 1). The goals focus attention on the need to both reduce morbidity and mortality, and to progressively eliminate malaria from countries that had malaria transmission in 2015. The GTS presents a framework through which the goals can be achieved (Table 1).  The\u00a0 GTS \u00a0   [4]   \u00a0states that it is essential for malaria programmes to 'ensure access to malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment as part of universal health coverage' (Pillar 1).\u00a0 Universal health coverage \u00a0(UHC) means that all individuals and communities receive the health services they need without suffering financial hardship. It includes the full spectrum of essential, quality health services, from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care. For malaria, WHO has recommended a range of interventions namely, vector control, chemoprevention, diagnostic testing and treatment, to reduce transmission and prevent morbidity and mortality. A UHC approach means ensuring that individuals and communities are covered by the appropriate mix of these interventions, based on local context, to control and ultimately eliminate malaria.   The principal objective of national malaria programmes (NMPs) is to combine a selection of these interventions into packages that are tailored to achieve sustainable and equitable impact in a given setting. To decide upon the appropriate intervention package and allocation of resources that will achieve this objective and contribute to UHC, programmes should use a process that combines the analysis of impact and value for money with extensive stakeholder engagement and discussion. The process should be informed by past and current malaria transmission intensity and incidence data; contextual vulnerability related to the human host, parasites, vectors, and past and present intervention coverage; acceptability; and equality of access and use (including analysis of financial barriers and how to address them). When the objective is elimination, a similar process is undertaken although the types of interventions and value for money analysis will be different than in high-burden settings.  Following progressive reductions in malaria burden between 2000 and 2015, progress stalled. By 2017, the world was off track to achieve the malaria morbidity and mortality reduction targets. In response, a revitalization effort called \u201c High burden to high impact \u00a0(HBHI)\u201d was launched in 2018    [5]    .\u00a0This approach focuses attention on how to get back on track: garnering political will to reduce the toll of malaria; using strategic information to drive impact; developing better guidance, policies and strategies; and improving coordination of support for national malaria responses. Although the impetus for articulating these key activities was the need to get back on track to achieve the GTS morbidity and mortality targets, these activities apply equally well to all malaria-endemic countries and to ensure continued progress towards the GTS elimination goals.     Objectives   These consolidated\u00a0 WHO Guidelines for malaria \u00a0aim to provide the latest evidence-based recommendations in one reference to support countries in their efforts to reduce and ultimately eliminate malaria. The objectives of the Guidelines are:    to provide evidence-based and context-sensitive recommendations on the appropriate choice(s) for malaria prevention (vector control and chemotherapies) and case management (diagnosis and treatment) across all transmission settings; \t to support the development by WHO Member States of evidence-based national malaria policies for prevention and case management across all transmission settings; \t to encourage the use of local data to inform subnational stratification to maximize the impact of available resources; and \t to inform the research agenda to enable updates to the Guidelines by identifying gaps in evidence that constrain the development of guidance or weaken current recommendations.      Target audience   The primary audience for these guidelines is policy-makers in ministries of health and the managers of NMPs in endemic countries. The Guidelines may also be of interest to health care practitioners, environmental health service professionals, procurement agencies, the private sector, and civil society groups. The Guidelines are also intended for use by international development partners, donors and funding agencies in order to support decision-making on allocation of resources for interventions and procurement of appropriate malaria control products. In addition, the Guidelines are intended to guide researchers, research funders and those interested in the outcomes of research to address the evidence gaps that are constraining the development of guidance or weakening current recommendations.     Scope   The consolidated\u00a0 WHO Guidelines for malaria \u00a0bring together all recommendations for malaria, including prevention using vector control and preventive chemotherapy, diagnosis, treatment and elimination strategies. The Guidelines also provide links to other resources including guidance and information on: strategic use of information to drive impact; surveillance, monitoring and evaluation; operational manuals, handbooks and frameworks; and a glossary of terms and definitions. \u00a0 The Guidelines provide:    evidence-based recommendations pertaining to vector control tools, technologies and approaches that are currently available for malaria prevention and control, and for which sufficient evidence on their efficacy is available to support systematic reviews. The Guidelines are intended to provide an underlying framework for the design of effective, evidence-based national vector control strategies and their adaptation to local disease epidemiology and vector bionomics; \t evidence-based recommendations on the use of antimalarial medicines as preventive chemotherapy in people living\u00a0in malaria-endemic areas who are at risk of malaria morbidity and mortality. These approaches include intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) in pregnancy (IPTp), IPT in infants (IPTi) and seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC); \t evidence-based recommendations on the treatment of uncomplicated and severe malaria in all age groups and situations, including in young children and pregnant women; and \t guidance on strategies for elimination settings (recommendations are in development).    No guidance is given on the use of antimalarial agents to prevent malaria in people travelling from non-endemic settings to areas of malaria transmission. This is available in the WHO\u00a0 International travel and health guidance\u00a0     [6]   .     Etiology   Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by the infection of red blood cells with protozoan parasites of the genus\u00a0 Plasmodium \u00a0that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female\u00a0 Anopheles \u00a0mosquitoes. Four species of Plasmodium ( P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae \u00a0and\u00a0 P. ovale ) most commonly infect humans.\u00a0 P. falciparum \u00a0and\u00a0 P. vivax \u00a0are the most prevalent species and\u00a0 P. falciparum \u00a0is the most dangerous. A fifth species,\u00a0 P. knowlesi \u00a0(a species of\u00a0 Plasmodium \u00a0that primarily infects non-human primates) is increasingly being reported in humans inhabiting forested regions of some countries of South-East Asia and the Western Pacific regions, and in particular on the island of Borneo.     Malaria transmission, acquisition of immunity, and clinical manifestations of disease\u00a0   The intensity of transmission depends on factors related to the parasite, the vector, the human host and the environment. Transmission tends to be more intense in places where the mosquito lifespan is longer and where the females prefer to bite humans rather than other animals. The survival and longevity of female mosquitoes is of critical importance in malaria transmission, as the malaria parasite generally requires a period of 7\u201310 days to develop inside the mosquito into a form that is infective to humans. Female mosquito longevity is dependent on intrinsic, genetic factors, as well as on environmental factors including temperature and humidity. The strong human-biting habit of the African vector species is one of the reasons why approximately 90% of the world\u2019s malaria cases occur in Africa. \u00a0 Transmission intensity is usually assessed as the incidence of cases or the prevalence of infection. Most countries have information on the annual parasite incidence (number of new parasitologically confirmed malaria cases per 1000 population per year) from routine surveillance and\/or on the parasite prevalence from surveys, often conducted during or just after periods of peak transmission\u00a0   [7]   . \u00a0 The following categories of transmission intensity are indicative and meant to provide an adaptable framework in which each country can conduct a stratification exercise to classify geographical units according to local malaria transmission.    Areas of high transmission are characterized by an annual parasite incidence of about 450 or more cases per 1000 population and a\u00a0 P. falciparum \u00a0prevalence rate of \u226535%. \t Moderate transmission areas have an annual parasite incidence of 250\u2013450 cases per 1000 population and a prevalence of\u00a0 P. falciparum\/P. vivax \u00a0malaria of 10\u201335%. \t Areas of low transmission have an annual parasite incidence of 100\u2013250 cases per 1000 population and a prevalence of\u00a0 P. falciparum\/P. vivax \u00a0of 1\u201310%. It should be noted that the incidence of cases or infections is a more useful measure in geographical units in which the prevalence is low, given the difficulty of measuring prevalence accurately at low levels\u00a0   [8]   . \t Very low transmission areas have an annual parasite incidence of &lt; 100 cases per 1000 population and a prevalence of\u00a0 P. falciparum\/P. vivax \u00a0malaria that is &gt; 0 but &lt; 1%.    \u00a0The relation between parasite incidence, parasite prevalence and the number of cases presenting to health facilities per week can be estimated using models\u00a0   [9]   . Differences in transmission from one area to another may be due to geographical characteristics, such as altitude, temperature, humidity, rainfall patterns, proximity to water bodies, land use, vector species and distribution, socio-demographic characteristics, access to antimalarial treatment, and coverage with vector control. In most endemic areas, seasonal patterns of transmission are observed, with high transmission during part of the year. Both the intensity and timing of transmission are important considerations in designing elimination strategies. \u00a0 The manifestation of clinical disease depends strongly on the background level of acquired protective immunity, which is a consequence of the pattern and intensity of malaria transmission in the area of residence. In areas of moderate to high transmission, partial immunity to clinical disease and a reduced risk of developing severe malaria are acquired in early childhood. The pattern of acquired immunity is similar across the Sahel subregion, where malaria transmission is intense only during the three- or four-month rainy season and low at other times. In both these situations, clinical disease is confined mainly to young children, who may develop high parasite densities that can progress rapidly to severe malaria. By contrast, in these settings, adolescents and adults are partially immune and suffer clinical disease much less frequently, although they are often infected with low blood-parasite densities. Immunity is modified in pregnancy and gradually lost, at least partially, when individuals move out of the endemic areas for prolonged periods (e.g., a year or more). \u00a0 In areas of low and very low transmission, as found in much of Asia, Latin America and other malaria-endemic areas, the transmission fluctuates widely by season, year, and over relatively small distances.\u00a0 P. vivax\u00a0 is an important cause of malaria in these regions. This generally low transmission delays acquisition of immunity, so that adults and children alike suffer from acute clinical malaria, with a significant risk for progression to severe malaria if left untreated. Epidemics may occur in these low or very low transmission areas when the inoculation rate increases rapidly because of a sudden increase in vectorial capacity. Epidemics may result in a very high incidence across all age groups, which can overwhelm health services. \u00a0 In moderate and high transmission areas with sustained high coverage of vector control and access to treatment, reduced exposure to malaria infection may change the population structure of acquired immunity to reflect that found in low or very low transmission areas, resulting in a corresponding change in the clinical epidemiology of malaria and an increasing risk of epidemics if control measures are not sustained.     Strategic information to tailor programmatic response and selection of interventions    As malaria control improves, malaria transmission and risk become increasingly heterogeneous, both between and within countries. Thus, a \u201cone-size-fits all\u201d approach to programme decisions on intervention selection becomes inefficient. The situation requires stratification of the country at subnational levels according to past, present and future malaria risk, the structure and function of the health system,\u00a0and other contextual factors. Stratification provides a rational basis to identify context-specific packages of interventions to target specific populations in the different subnational strata. Local data are essential to complete stratification and to inform the selection of the optimal mixes of interventions to maximize impact. Given that resource constraints usually limit the implementation of all desirable interventions in all areas of malaria risk, a prioritization exercise must also be conducted to ensure that resource allocation also optimizes intervention mixes and resultant\u00a0impact. Guidance on these activities is available in  Section 7 : Surveillance.   The choice of interventions in each stratum should be informed by WHO\u2019s recommendations. However, given the complexities of malaria, with heterogeneity of risk and the unique contexts that every programme has to consider, global guidance is not intended and should not be used to provide prescriptive guidance on what should be done in every situation. These Guidelines signal a paradigm shift towards a problem-solving approach using local data to identify recommendations that are relevant at a country level and based on local context,\u00a0defining stratum-specific\u00a0 packages of interventions that optimize impact and are prioritized for resource allocation. This shift moves away from overly prescriptive recommendations and will clearly distinguish evidence-informed recommendations from contextual considerations. The contextual considerations at national and subnational levels will inform how recommendations should be applied and strategies that may increase access for the target population.   Accurate stratification of malaria transmission intensity is essential for effective targeting of interventions. As countries progress towards elimination, finer scale mapping is required, and stratification should be more specific, ideally at the level of localities or health facility catchment areas\u00a0   [10]       [11]   . As transmission intensity is progressively reduced, stratification needs to include vulnerability and receptivity to malaria, i.e. the risk for importation of malaria cases and the inherent potential of the vector-human ecosystem to transmit malaria. \u00a0   Conclusion   These Guidelines therefore provide a framework within which NMPs and their implementing partners may adopt and adapt the recommendations for use. Good quality surveillance data can also feed into this process by providing the granular local information needed to inform and evaluate national programme decisions (see  Section 7 : Surveillance). Where the boundaries of current knowledge are pushed, it is particularly important to ensure adequate attention to monitoring and evaluation. The information generated can then feed into updated guidance."},{"nid":698,"text_data":"3 Abbreviations    ACT    artemisinin-based combination therapy    ANC    antenatal care    bw    body weight    CI    confidence interval    CIDG    Cohrane Infectious Diseases Group    DPT    diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (vaccine)    EIR    entomological inoculation rate    EPI    expanded programme on immunization    GMP    Global Malaria Programme    GRADE    Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation    GTS      Global technical strategy for malaria (2016 - 2030)      G6PD    glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase    HRP2    histidine-rich protein 2    IPTi    intermittent preventive treatment in infants    IPTp    intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy    IRM    insecticide resistance management    IRS    indoor residual spraying    IOS    International Organization for Standardization    ITNs    insecticide-treated nets    ITPS    insectidie-treated plastic sheeting    IVM    integrated vector management    LLIN    long-lasting insecticidal net    LSM    larval source management    MPAG    Malaria Policy Advisory Group ( previously Malaria Policy Advisory Committee )    NAAT    nucleic acid amplification test    PBO    piperonyl butoxide    PCR    polymerase chain reaction      P fHRP2      Plasmodium falciparum  histidine-rich protein-2    PICO    population, participants or patients; intervention or indicator; comparator or control; outcome    PQ    prequalification (WHO)      p LDH      parasite -lactate dehydrogenase    P vdhfr        Plasmodium vivax  dihydrofolate reductase gene    RCT    randomized controlled trial    RDT    rapid diagnostic test    RR    relative risk, or risk ratio    SP    sulfadoxine\u2013pyrimethamine    SP + AQ    sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine + amodiaquine    SMC    seasonal malaria chemoprevention    TES    therapeutic efficacy studies    VCAG    Vector Control Advisory Group    VCTEG    Technical Expert Group on Malaria Vector Control    WHO    World Health Organization"},{"nid":699,"text_data":"4 Prevention  Nearly half of the world\u2019s population is at risk of malaria.

The interventions are divided into categories of those recommended for large-scale deployment and those recommended as supplementary. Interventions that are recommended for large-scale deployment are those that have demonstrated public health value, i.e., have proven protective efficacy to reduce or prevent infection and\/or disease in humans at the community level, and - in the case of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) - at the individual level, and that are broadly applicable for populations at risk of malaria in most epidemiological and ecological settings. Supplementary interventions are those with conditional recommendations that may be applicable for specific populations, situations or settings. These include personal protection measures that have a primary use-pattern of protecting individual users, although they may have some as yet unproven impact when deployed at the community level.     Vectors, their behaviour and distribution   Malaria is transmitted through the bites of infective female\u00a0 Anopheles \u00a0mosquitoes. There are more than 400 different species of\u00a0 Anopheles \u00a0mosquitoes, of which around 40 are malaria vectors of major importance.\u00a0 Anopheles \u00a0mosquitoes lay their eggs in water. The eggs hatch to produce larvae, which undergo several moults before emerging from the pupal stage as adult mosquitoes. Different species of\u00a0 Anopheles \u00a0mosquito have their own preferred aquatic habitats; for example, some prefer small, shallow collections of fresh water such as puddles and animal hoof prints, whereas others prefer large, open water bodies including lakes, swamps and rice fields.   Immediately after emerging from the pupal stage, mosquitoes rest on the water surface until their wings have fully expanded and hardened. After taking an initial meal of plant nectar, female mosquitoes seek a blood meal, as they require protein to develop their eggs. In the majority of species of\u00a0 Anopheles , the females feed on warm-blooded animals, usually mammals. Different mosquito species demonstrate preferences for feeding on animals (zoophily) or on humans (anthropophily); however, these preferences are not absolute, and females may take a blood meal from a non-preferred host when these are present in the area. Blood-feeding can take place inside human habitations (endophagy) or outdoors (exophagy), depending on the mosquito species. Several factors have been implicated in the attraction of female mosquitoes to a host, including exhaled carbon dioxide, lactic acid, host odours, warmth and moisture. Different host individuals may be more or less attractive to mosquitoes than other individuals of the same species.   Female\u00a0 Anopheles \u00a0mosquitoes feed predominantly at night, although some species may bite during the day in heavily shaded conditions, and some exhibit a peak in biting activity in the early evening or early morning. The interplay between the peak biting time of the\u00a0 Anopheles \u00a0vector and the activity and sleeping patterns of the human host has important consequences for malaria transmission and the choice of appropriate vector control interventions.   After blood-feeding, female mosquitoes rest in order to digest the blood meal and mature their eggs. Female mosquitoes may rest indoors (endophily) or outdoors (exophily), and this depends on innate species preferences as well as the availability of suitable resting sites in the local environment. The mosquitoes\u2019 choice of post-feeding resting site also has major implications for the selection of control interventions.   It is important to note that while an individual species of\u00a0 Anopheles \u00a0will characteristically exhibit certain biting and resting behaviours, these are not absolute; subpopulations and individuals may exhibit different behaviours depending on a combination of intrinsic genetic factors, availability of preferred hosts and availability of suitable resting sites. Environmental and climatic factors, including rainfall, moonlight, wind speed, etc., as well as the deployment of vector control interventions can all influence biting and resting behaviours. For example, the highly efficient African malaria vector\u00a0 Anopheles gambiae s.s. \u00a0is generally considered to be human-biting, indoor-biting and indoor-resting, but it can also exhibit more zoophilic and exophagic tendencies. \u00a0Anopheles arabiensis \u00a0is a species that generally exhibits an outdoor biting and resting habit, but may exhibit indoor biting and resting tendencies, depending on the availability of alternative hosts.   Accurate species identification is crucial for all studies and surveillance activities on field populations of vectors. Many of the vectors belong to species complexes and require advanced molecular analyses for species identification, necessitating appropriate laboratory resources. Without accurate species identification, the data collected on behaviour, distribution and infection rates will have limited use for decision-making by control programmes.    Background and rationale for vector control   The role of arthropods in the transmission of diseases to humans was first elucidated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since effective vaccines or drugs were not always available for the prevention or treatment of these diseases, control of transmission often had to rely principally on control of the vector. Early control activities included the screening of houses, the use of mosquito nets, the drainage or filling of swamps and other water bodies used by insects for breeding, and the application of oil or Paris green to breeding places. Following the discovery of the insecticidal properties of\u00a0 dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in the 1940s and subsequent discovery of other insecticides, the focus of malaria vector control shifted to the deployment of insecticides to target both the larval and adult stages of mosquito vectors.   Nowadays, it is well established that effective vector control programmes can make a major contribution to advancing human and economic development. Aside from direct health benefits, reductions in vector-borne diseases enable greater productivity and growth, reduce household poverty, increase equity and women\u2019s empowerment, and strengthen health systems\u00a0   [12]   . Despite the clear evidence in broad support of vector control efforts, the major vector-borne diseases combined still account for around 17% of the estimated global burden of communicable diseases, claiming more than 700 000 lives every year\u00a0   [13]   . Recognizing the great potential to enhance efforts in this area, WHO led the development of the\u00a0   Global vector control response 2017\u20132030     \u00a0      [13]   , which is outlined in the subsequent section.   The control of malaria, unlike that of most other vector-borne diseases, saw a major increase in financial resources from 2000 to about 2010, leading to a significant reduction in the global burden. However, since 2010, total malaria funding has largely stagnated. Moreover, the funding gap between the amount invested and the resources needed has continued to widen significantly in recent years, largely as a result of population growth and the need to switch to more expensive tools. This gap increased from US$ 1.3 billion in 2017 to US$ 2.3 billion in 2018, and to US$ 2.6 billion in 2019\u00a0   [3]   .   Between 2000 and 2015, the infection prevalence of\u00a0 Plasmodium\u00a0P. falciparum \u00a0in endemic Africa was halved and the incidence of clinical disease fell by 40%\u00a0   [14]   . Malaria control interventions averted an estimated 663 million (credible interval (CI) 542\u2013753 million) clinical cases in Africa, with ITNs making the largest contribution (68% of cases averted). Indoor residual spraying (IRS) contributed an estimated 13% (11\u201316%), with a larger proportional contribution where intervention coverage was high\u00a0   [14]   .       Global vector control response 2017\u20132030     The vision of WHO and the broader infectious diseases community is a world free of human suffering from vector-borne diseases. In 2017, the World Health Assembly welcomed the\u00a0   Global vector control response 2017\u20132030\u00a0       [13]   \u00a0(GVCR) and adopted a resolution to promote an integrated approach to the control of vector-borne diseases. The approach builds on the concept of integrated vector management (IVM), but with renewed focus on improved human capacity, strengthening infrastructure and systems, improved surveillance, and better coordination and integrated action across sectors and diseases.   The ultimate aim of the GVCR is to reduce the burden and threat of vector-borne diseases through effective, locally adapted, sustainable vector control in full alignment with Sustainable Development Goal 3.3: to end epidemics of malaria by 2030. The 2030 targets are: to reduce mortality due to vector-borne diseases globally by at least 75% (relative to 2016); to reduce case incidence due to vector-borne diseases globally by at least 60% (relative to 2016); and to prevent epidemics of vector-borne diseases in all\u00a0countries. Detailed national and regional priority activities and associated interim targets for 2017\u20132022 have also been defined.   Priority activities set out in the GVCR fall within four4\u00a0pillars that are underpinned by two2\u00a0foundational elements:   Pillars of action:    Strengthen inter- and intra-sectoral action and collaboration. \t Engage and mobilize communities. \t Enhance vector surveillance, monitoring and evaluation of interventions. \t Scale up and integrate tools and approaches.    Foundations:    Enhance vector control capacity and capability. \t Increase basic and applied research, and innovation.    Effective and sustainable vector control is achievable only with sufficient human resources, an enabling infrastructure and a functional health system. National programmes should lead a vector control needs assessment across the relevant sectors\u00a0   [15]   \u00a0to help appraise current capacity, define the requisite capacity to conduct proposed activities, identify opportunities for improved efficiency in vector control delivery, and guide resource mobilization to implement the national strategic plan.   In some settings, vector control interventions have the potential to reduce transmission and disease burden of more than one disease. Examples include the deployment of ITNs against malaria and lymphatic filariasis (in settings where\u00a0 Anopheles \u00a0mosquitoes are the principal vector), against malaria and leishmaniasis in India, and larval control for malaria and dengue vectors in cities with particular vector habitats. With the recently documented invasion of\u00a0 Anopheles stephensi \u00a0in the Horn of Africa, the integrated surveillance and control of this vector alongside\u00a0 Aedes \u00a0provides a clear opportunity for GVCR implementation. More approaches effective against\u00a0 Aedes \u00a0spp. mosquitoes generally have the potential to impact dengue, chikungunya, Zika virus disease and possibly yellow fever where their vectors and distributions overlap.     Prevention, mitigation and management of insecticide resistance   Widespread and increasing insecticide resistance poses a threat to effective malaria vector control. Failure to mitigate and manage insecticide resistance is likely to result in an increased burden of disease, potentially reversing some of the substantial gains made in controlling malaria over the last decade.   WHO maintains a global insecticide resistance database and an online mapping tool that consolidate information on the status of the insecticide susceptibility of\u00a0 Anopheles \u00a0mosquitoes in malaria-endemic countries\u00a0   [16]   . The latest data revealed that almost 90% of the malaria-endemic countries reporting insecticide resistance have detected resistance of their vectors to at least one insecticide class. Globally, resistance to pyrethroids is widespread, having been detected in at least one malaria vector in 70% of the sites for which data were available. Resistance to organochlorines was reported in 63% of the sites. Resistance to carbamates and organophosphates was less prevalent, detected in 32% and 35% of the sites that reported monitoring data, respectively\u00a0   [3]   .   To date, there is no evidence of operational failure of vector control programmes as a direct result of increasing frequency of pyrethroid resistance\u00a0   [17]       [18]   .\u00a0Based on past experience, however, it is likely that operational failure will eventually occur if effective insecticide resistance management (IRM) strategies are not designed and implemented. Ideally, such strategies should be implemented early to prevent spread and increase in the intensity of resistance. The overarching concepts of such resistance management strategies were outlined in the\u00a0   Global plan for insecticide resistance management in malaria vectors   \u00a0(GPIRM) in 2012\u00a0   [19]   .   Guidance on monitoring of insecticide resistance, interpretation of test results interpretations and implications for decision-making are given in the WHO Test procedures for monitoring insecticide resistance in malaria vector mosquitoes\u00a0   [20]   \u00a0and in the Framework for a national plan for monitoring and the management of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors\u00a0   [21]   . When deciding whether adjustments to the national malaria strategic plan are required in a given area, at least the following must be considered for that locality:    current and past transmission levels; \t current and past interventions deployed, including the coverage, usage and duration of efficacy; \t the insecticide resistance profile of the main vector species (including resistance intensity and resistance mechanisms); and \t other entomological information including vector species distribution, abundance, and other bionomic data.    The susceptibility of mosquitoes to insecticides and determination of the species-specific presence, intensity and mechanisms of resistance in vector populations can be used to guide the selection of the most appropriate\u00a0 insecticidal products to deploy. Generally, if mosquitoes are found to be resistant to an insecticide, insecticides with a different mode of action should be deployed. However, there are reports of mosquitoes having differential susceptibility to insecticides within the same class, and questions have been raised about the level of cross-resistance between pyrethroid products\u00a0   [19]   . The Global Fund recently commissioned a review of the interpretation of insecticide resistance assays when selecting insecticidal products\u00a0   [22]   . The review aimed to answer the question: in areas where pyrethroid resistance exists, but mosquitoes of the same population differ in their susceptibility to different pyrethroids, should programmes consider selecting one pyrethroid over another in order to manage insecticide resistance? Based on a review of evidence from molecular, laboratory and field data, the authors concluded that differences between adult mosquito mortalities in pyrethroid insecticide resistance assays are not indicative of a true or operationally relevant difference in the potential performance of pyrethroids currently in common use (deltamethrin, permethrin, \u03b1-cypermethrin and \u03bb-cyhalothrin). Consequently, switching between pyrethroid insecticides (to improve intervention efficacy) should not be used as a means of managing insecticide resistance. This finding supports WHO\u2019s past and present position. Given that pyrethroid resistance in mosquitoes is widespread, WHO encourages the development and continued evaluation of nets treated with alternative insecticides\u00a0   [23]       Key technical principles for addressing insecticide resistance are as follows:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Insecticides should be deployed with care and deliberation in order to reduce unnecessary selection pressure and maximize impact on disease. National malaria programmes should consider whether they are using insecticides judiciously, carefully and with discrimination, and if there is a clear epidemiological benefit. \t Vector control programmes should avoid using a single class of insecticide everywhere and over consecutive years. Whenever possible, vector control programmes should diversify from pyrethroids to preserve their effectiveness. Although pyrethroids will continue to be used for ITNs in the near term, they should not generally be deployed for IRS in areas with pyrethroid ITNs, whether alone or combined with insecticides from a different class. \t IRM principles and methods should be incorporated into all vector control programmes, not as an option, but as a core component of programme design. \t National malaria programmes should engage with the agricultural sector to coordinate insecticide use, with the aim of avoiding use of the same classes of insecticide for both crop protection and public health within the same geographical area. \t Routine monitoring of insecticide resistance is essential to inform the selection and deployment of insecticides. \t The additional costs of deploying new vector control tools as part of a comprehensive IRM response should be balanced against the potential long-term public health impact. Where feasible formal economic evaluation is encouraged to investigate the likely incremental costs and effectiveness of potential IRM approaches, relative to feasible alternatives, for a given context.      Approaches   Historically, the most common way insecticides have been deployed to control malaria vectors has been through \u201csequential use\u201d.\u00a0 In essence, this is when a single insecticide class is used continuously or repeatedly until resistance has rendered it less effective or ineffective, after which a switch is made to an insecticide with a different mode of action to which there is no (or less) resistance. In theory, this may allow for an eventual switch back to the original insecticide class if resistance decreases to the point that it is no longer detectable by means of bioassays.\u00a0   The agricultural industry has had\u00a0some success in managing resistance by using \u00a0different insecticides over space and time. Similar approaches have been proposed with the aim of preventing or delaying the spread and increase of resistance by removing selection pressure or by killing resistant mosquitoes. However, there is no empirical evidence of their\u00a0success of these strategies for malaria vector control, which is likely to depend on mosquito genetics, behaviour and population dynamics, and the chemical nature of the insecticides and their formulation. These strategies include mixtures of insecticides, mosaic spraying, rotations of insecticides and deployment of multiple interventions in combination.    Mixtures are co-formulations that combine two or more insecticides with different modes of action. Mixtures are widely used as drug treatments in co-formulated combination therapy. Effective deployment of a mixture requires the presence of resistance to all insecticides in the mixture to be rare, so that any individual mosquito that survives exposure to one insecticide is highly likely to be killed by the other insecticide or insecticides. Ideally, all insecticides in a mixture should have a similar residual life and remain bioavailable over time; in practice, this is difficult to achieve, particularly for vector control products that are meant to last for a number of years, such as long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs). An ITN product containing a pyrethroid and a pyrrole insecticide and another containing a pyrethroid and a juvenile hormone mimic have been developed and prequalified by WHO\u00a0   [24]   . WHO will require data on the epidemiological impact of these\u00a0products\u00a0to enable assessment of their\u00a0public health value and to develop a WHO recommendation. A mixture of a pyrethroid and a neonicotinoid insecticide for IRS was recently prequalified by WHO. \t Rotations involve switching between insecticides with different modes of action at pre-set time intervals, irrespective of resistance frequencies. The theory is that resistance frequencies will decline (or at least not increase) during the period of non-deployment of insecticides with a specific mode of action. \t Mosaics involve the deployment of insecticides with different modes of action in neighbouring geographical areas. The optimal spatial scale (size of areas) for mosaics has yet to be determined, and rotations are generally considered to be more practical and feasible. \t Combinations expose the vector population to two classes of insecticides with differing modes of action through the co-deployment of different interventions in the same place. For instance, pyrethroid-only LLINs combined with a non-pyrethroid IRS (where both are at high coverage) is a potential approach to IRM, although there is little evidence to indicate that such a combination of interventions would\u00a0lead to additional epidemiological impact relative to one intervention deployed at high coverage (see recommendation under  section 4.1.2 ).    For vector control, there is still little evidence and no consensus on the best IRM approach or approaches to apply in a given situation. A 2013 review of experimental and modelling studies on insecticide, pesticide and drug resistance concluded that mixtures generally lead to the slowest evolution of resistance\u00a0   [25]   . However, more recently, an exploration of overlaps between agriculture and public health found that \u2013 owing to caveats and case specificity \u2013 there is only weak evidence of one IRM approach being better than another, and that the standard practice of using insecticides until resistance emerges before switching to an alternative (i.e., sequential use) may be equally effective under certain circumstances. More research is needed to compare resistance management approaches in the field\u00a0   [26]   \u00a0and to improve understanding of the biological mechanisms that are likely to favour different approaches in different situations\u00a0   [27]       [28]   .     Evidence-based planning   Given the heavy reliance on insecticidal interventions \u2013 primarily ITNs and IRS \u2013 insecticide resistance of local vectors is a key consideration in vector control planning and implementation. Ideally, IRM practices should be implemented as part of routine operations, rather than waiting for resistance to spread or increase and for control failure to be suspected or confirmed. A pragmatic approach must be taken that seeks to select appropriate vector control interventions based on the insecticide resistance profile of the major malaria vectors in the target area. To outline how resistance will be monitored and managed, national malaria programmes should develop and implement national plans in accordance with the WHO\u00a0   Framework for a national plan for monitoring and management of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors     \u00a0     [21]   . Detailed information on insecticide resistance monitoring methods and on how to use the data to inform the selection of appropriate interventions will be provided in the revised WHO\u00a0 Test procedures of monitoring insecticide resistance in malaria vectors \u00a0anticipated to be published in 2021.   IRM\u00a0plans should be revisited regularly to consider new information, and to integrate new interventions,\u00a0once they have been supported by WHO recommendations and prequalified. Further information on insecticide resistance monitoring and, more broadly, on entomological surveillance is included in the WHO reference manual on malaria surveillance, monitoring and evaluation, which outlines priority data across different transmission settings\u00a0   [29]   .     Vector control across different malaria transmission settings   Understanding the degree of risk of malaria transmission in a given geographic area provides the foundation for the design of cost-effective intervention programmes to decrease malaria burden, eliminate transmission and prevent re-establishment of malaria. The risk of malaria transmission is the product of receptivity, importation risk and infectivity of imported parasites, and is referred to as the malariogenic potential. The receptivity of an ecosystem to malaria transmission is determined by the presence of competent vectors, a suitable climate and a susceptible human population. Importation risk, sometimes referred to as vulnerability, refers to the probability of influx of infected individuals and\/or infective anopheline mosquitoes. Infectivity depends on the ability of a given\u00a0 Plasmodium \u00a0strain to establish an infection in an\u00a0 Anopheles \u00a0mosquito species and undergo development until the mosquito has sporozoites in its salivary glands.\u00a0   National malaria programmes should undertake stratification by malariogenic potential in order to: differentiate receptive from non-receptive areas; identify receptive areas in which malaria transmission has already been curtailed by current interventions; distinguish between areas with widespread transmission and those in which transmission occurs only in discrete foci; and determine geographical variations and population characteristics that are associated with importation risk\u00a0   [7]   .   Specific packages of interventions may be designed for implementation in the various strata identified. These may include:    enhancement and optimization of vector control; \t further strengthening of timely detection, high-quality diagnosis (confirmation), and management and tracking of cases; \t strategies to accelerate clearance of parasites or vectors in order to reduce transmission rapidly when possible; \t information, detection and response systems to identify, investigate and clear remaining malaria foci.    Access to effective vector control interventions will need to be maintained in the majority of countries and locations where malaria control has been effective. This includes settings with ongoing malaria transmission, as well as those in which transmission has been interrupted but in which some level of receptivity and vulnerability remains. Malaria elimination is defined as the interruption of local transmission (reduction to zero incidence of indigenous cases) of a specified malaria parasite species in a defined geographical area as a result of deliberate intervention activities. Following elimination, continued measures to prevent re-establishment of transmission are usually required\u00a0   [29]   .\u00a0Interventions are no longer required once eradication has been achieved. Malaria eradication is defined as the permanent reduction to zero of the worldwide incidence of infection caused by all human malaria parasite species as a result of deliberate activities.   A comprehensive review of historical evidence and mathematical simulation modelling undertaken for WHO in 2015 indicated that the scale-back of malaria vector control was associated with a high probability of malaria resurgence, including for most scenarios in areas where malaria transmission was very low or had been interrupted. Both the historical review and the simulation modelling clearly indicated that the risk of resurgence was significantly greater at higher entomological inoculation rates (EIRs) and case importation rates, and lower coverage of active case detection and case management\u00a0   [30]   .   During the pre-elimination and elimination phases, ensuring\u00a0access to vector control for at-risk populations remains a priority, even though the size and specific identity of the at-risk populations may change as malaria transmission is reduced.   As malaria incidence falls and elimination is approached, increasing heterogeneity in transmission will result in foci with ongoing transmission in which vector control should be enhanced. Such foci may be due to particularly intense vectorial capacity, lapsed prevention and treatment services, changes in vectors or parasites that make the current strategies less effective, or reintroduction of malaria parasites by the movement of infected people or, more rarely, infected mosquitoes. Guidance on entomological surveillance across the continuum from control to elimination is provided elsewhere\u00a0   [29]   .   Once elimination has been achieved, vector control may need to be continued by targeting defined at-risk populations to prevent reintroduction or resumption of local transmission.   It is acknowledged that malaria transmission can persist following the implementation of a widely effective malaria programme. The sources and risks of\u00a0\u2018residual transmission\u2019\u00a0may vary by location, time and the existing components of the current \u201ceffective malaria programme\u201d. This variation is potentially due to a combination of both mosquito and human behaviours, such as when people live in or visit forest areas or do not sleep in protected houses, or when local mosquito vector species bite and\/or rest outdoors and thereby avoid contact with IRS or ITNs.   Supplementary interventions may be used in addition to ITNs or IRS\u00a0in specific settings and circumstances. Recommendations on larviciding with chemical or biological insecticides are outlined in a subsequent chapter. Implementation of supplementary interventions should be in accordance with the principles outlined in the\u00a0   Global vector control response 2017\u20132030     \u00a0     [13]     .     Once elimination has been achieved, vector control coverage should be maintained in receptive areas where there is a substantial risk for reintroduction.   There is a critical need for all countries with ongoing malaria transmission, and in particular those approaching elimination, to build and maintain strong capacity in disease and entomological surveillance and health systems. The capacity to detect and respond to possible resurgences with appropriate vector control relies on having the necessary entomological information (i.e., susceptibility status of vectors to insecticides, as well as their biting and resting preferences). Such capacity is also required for the detailed assessment of malariogenic potential, which\u00a0is a pre-condition for determining whether vector control can be scaled back (or focalized).     Summary of recommendations   Vector control is a vital component of malaria prevention, control and elimination strategies.\u00a0Development of WHO recommendations for vector control interventions relies on evidence from well-designed and well-conducted trials and studies with epidemiological endpoints that demonstrate the public health value of the intervention\u00a0   [31]   . The consolidated Guidelines\u00a0incorporate: i)\u00a0recommendations based on systematic reviews of the available evidence on the effectiveness of\u00a0vector control interventions; and ii) existing WHO recommendations developed previously. Evidence profiles reporting impact on malaria outcomes, as published in the systematic reviews are provided for each intervention.

The \u00a0 Guidelines cover interventions that are recommended for large-scale deployment and those that are recommended as supplementary interventions. Malaria vector control interventions recommended for large-scale deployment are applicable for all populations at risk of malaria in most epidemiological and ecological settings, namely: i) deployment of ITNs that are prequalified by WHO, which in many settings continue to be long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs); and ii) IRS with a product prequalified by WHO. Once optimal coverage with one of these interventions has been achieved, supplementary interventions may be considered for deployment depending on the specifics of the settings."},{"nid":701,"text_data":"4.2 Preventive chemotherapies & Mass drug administration  Chemoprevention is the use of antimalarial medicines for prophylaxis and for preventive treatment. The use of medicines for chemoprophylaxis is not addressed in detail in the current guidelines, beyond the following\u00a0short description of general conditions of use.   Malaria may be prevented by taking drugs that inhibit liver-stage (pre-erythrocytic) development (causal prophylaxis) or drugs that kill asexual blood stages (suppressive prophylaxis). Causal prophylactics (atovaquone + proguanil, primaquine) can be stopped soon after leaving an endemic area, whereas suppressive prophylactics must be taken for at least 4 weeks after leaving the area in order to eliminate asexual parasites emerging from the liver weeks after exposure. For travellers, chemoprophylaxis is started before entering the endemic area to assess tolerability and for slowly eliminated drugs to build up therapeutic concentrations.   Preventive treatments prevent malarial illness by achieving therapeutic drug levels in the blood throughout the period of greatest risk. Current WHO-recommended malaria chemopreventive therapies include the intermittent preventive treatment\u00a0of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp), intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in infants (IPTi) and seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC).     Mass Drug Administration to reduce morbidity and mortality   Mass antimalarial drug administration (MDA) has been used extensively in various forms over the past 80 years. The objective is to provide therapeutic concentrations of antimalarial drugs to as large a proportion of the target population as possible in order to cure any asymptomatic infections and also to prevent reinfection during the period of post-treatment prophylaxis\u00a0   [80]   .\u00a0Mass drug administration rapidly reduces the prevalence and incidence of malaria in the short term, but more studies are required to assess its longer-term impact, the barriers to community uptake, and its potential contribution to the development of drug resistance\u00a0   [81]   .   The aim of MDA has generally been to reduce malaria transmission (see  section 6 )\u00a0but, in recent years, time-limited MDA has also been used to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality for epidemic control as part of the initial response, along with the urgent introduction of other interventions. Use of time-limited MDA has also been used to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality in complex emergencies, during exceptional circumstances when the health system is overwhelmed and unable to serve the affected communities.   During mass campaigns, every individual in a defined population or geographical area is requested to take antimalarial treatment at approximately the same time and at repeated intervals in a coordinated manner. This requires extensive community engagement to achieve a high level of community acceptance and participation. Informed, enthusiastic community participation and comprehensive support structures are needed.   The optimum timing depends of the elimination kinetics of the antimalarial\u00a0 (e.g. using dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine, the drug is given monthly for 3 months at treatment doses, as the residual piperaquine levels suppress reinfections for 1 month). Depending on the contraindications for the medicines used, pregnant women, young infants and other population groups may need to be excluded from the campaign. Thus, the drugs used, the number of treatment rounds, the optimum intervals and the support structures necessary are all context-specific and the subject of active research.   Medicines used for MDA should be of proven efficacy in the implementation area and preferably have a long half-life. WHO recommends that a medicine different from that used for first line treatment be used for MDA. Programmes should include monitoring of efficacy, safety and the potential emergence of resistance to the antimalarial medicines deployed for MDA\u00a0   [82]   .   WHO supports the need for more research on the optimum methods of implementing MDA programmes, promoting community participation and compliance with treatment, and evaluating their effectiveness. Modelling can help guide the optimum method of administering MDA in different epidemiological circumstances and predict its likely impact. \u00a0   The evidence for MDA use to reduce malaria disease burden will be reviewed in 2021 and guidance developed accordingly. In the absence of sufficient evidence, WHO does not recommend the use of MDA in situations other than for areas approaching elimination, epidemics, and complex emergencies\u00a0   [83]   .

The WHO Guidelines for the treatment of malaria were first developed in 2006 and have been revised periodically, with the most recent edition published in 2015. WHO guidelines contain recommendations on clinical practice or public health policy intended to guide end-users as to the individual or collective actions that can or should be taken in specific situations to achieve the best possible health outcomes. Such recommendations are also designed to help the user to select and prioritize interventions from a range of potential alternatives. The third edition of the WHO Guidelines for the treatment of malaria consolidated here contains updated recommendations based on new evidence particularly related to dosing in children, and also includes recommendations on the use of drugs to prevent malaria in groups at high risk.  Since publication of the first edition of the  Guidelines for the treatment of malaria  in 2006 and the second edition in 2010, all countries in which  P. falciparum  malaria is endemic have progressively updated their treatment policy from use of monotherapy with drugs such as chloroquine, amodiaquine and sulfadoxine\u2013pyrimethamine (SP) to the currently recommended artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT). The ACTs are generally highly effective and well tolerated. This has contributed substantially to reductions in global morbidity and mortality from malaria. Unfortunately, resistance to artemisinins has arisen recently in  P. falciparum  in South-East Asia, which threatens these gains.    Core principles    The following core principles were used by the Guidelines Development Group that drew up the Guidelines for the Treatment of Malaria.    1. Early diagnosis and prompt, effective treatment of malaria    Uncomplicated falciparum malaria can progress rapidly to severe\u00a0forms of the disease, especially in people with no or low immunity, and severe falciparum malaria is almost always fatal without treatment. Therefore, programmes should ensure access to early diagnosis and prompt, effective treatment within 24\u201348 h of the onset of malaria symptoms.    2. Rational use of antimalarial agents    To reduce the spread of drug resistance, limit unnecessary use of antimalarial drugs and better identify other febrile illnesses in the context of changing malaria epidemiology, antimalarial medicines should be administered only to patients who truly have malaria. Adherence to a full treatment course must be promoted. Universal access to parasitological diagnosis of malaria is now possible with the use of quality-assured rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), which are also appropriate for use in primary health care and community settings.    3. Combination therapy    Preventing or delaying resistance is essential for the success of both national and global strategies for control and eventual elimination of malaria. To help protect current and future antimalarial medicines, all episodes of malaria should be treated with at least two effective antimalarial medicines with different mechanisms of action (combination therapy).    4. Appropriate weight-based dosing    To prolong their useful therapeutic life and ensure that all patients have an equal chance of being cured, the quality of antimalarial drugs must be ensured and antimalarial drugs must be given at optimal dosages. Treatment should maximize the likelihood of rapid clinical and parasitological cure and minimize transmission from the treated infection. To achieve this, dosage regimens should be based on the patient\u2019s weight and should provide effective concentrations of antimalarial drugs for a sufficient time to eliminate the infection in all target populations.  Please refer to    Malaria case management: operations manual       [91]   ."},{"nid":703,"text_data":"5.1 Diagnosing malaria (2015)    Suspected malaria    The signs and symptoms of malaria are non-specific. Malaria is suspected clinically primarily on the basis of fever or a history of fever. There is no combination of signs or symptoms that reliably distinguishes malaria from other causes of fever; diagnosis based only on clinical features has very low specificity and results in overtreatment. Other possible causes of fever and whether alternative or additional treatment is required must always be carefully considered. The focus of malaria diagnosis should be to identify patients who truly have malaria, to guide rational use of antimalarial medicines.  In malaria-endemic areas, malaria should be suspected in any patient presenting with a history of fever or temperature \u2265 37.5 \u00b0C and no other obvious cause. In areas in which malaria transmission is stable (or during the high-transmission period of seasonal malaria), malaria should also be suspected in children with palmar pallor or a haemoglobin concentration of &lt; 8 g\/dL. High-transmission settings include many parts of sub-Saharan Africa and some parts of Oceania.  In settings where the incidence of malaria is very low, parasitological diagnosis of all cases of fever may result in considerable expenditure to detect only a few patients with\u00a0malaria. In these settings, health workers should be trained to identify patients who may have been exposed to malaria (e.g. recent travel to a malaria-endemic area without protective measures) and have fever or a history of fever with no other obvious cause, before they conduct a parasitological test.    In all settings, suspected malaria should be confirmed with a parasitological test . The results of parasitological diagnosis should be available within a short time (&lt; 2 h) of the patient presenting. In settings where parasitological diagnosis is not possible, a decision to provide antimalarial treatment must be based on the probability that the illness is malaria.  In children &lt; 5 years, the practical algorithms for management of the sick child provided by the WHO\u2013United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) strategy for Integrated Management of Childhood Illness    [92]    should be used to ensure full assessment and appropriate case management at first-level health facilities and at the community level.    Parasitological diagnosis    The benefit of parasitological diagnosis relies entirely on an appropriate management response of health care providers. The two methods used routinely for parasitological diagnosis of malaria are light microscopy and immunochromatographic RDTs. The latter detect parasite-specific antigens or enzymes that are either genus or species specific.  Both microscopy and RDTs must be supported by a quality assurance programme. Antimalarial treatment should be limited to cases with positive tests, and patients with negative results should be reassessed for other common causes of fever and treated appropriately.  In nearly all cases of symptomatic malaria, examination of thick and thin blood films by a competent microscopist will reveal malaria parasites. Malaria RDTs should be used if quality-assured malaria microscopy is not readily available. RDTs for detecting PfHRP2 can be useful for patients who have received incomplete antimalarial treatment, in whom blood films can be negative. This is particularly likely if the patient received a recent dose of an artemisinin derivative. If the initial blood film examination is negative in patients with manifestations compatible with severe malaria, a series of blood films should be examined at 6\u201312 h intervals, or an RDT (preferably one detecting PfHRP2) should be performed. If both the slide examination and the RDT results are negative, malaria is extremely unlikely, and other causes of the illness should be sought and treated.  This document does not include recommendations for use of specific RDTs or for interpreting test results. For guidance, see the WHO manual    Universal access to malaria diagnostic testing       [93]        Diagnosis of malaria    In patients with suspected severe malaria and in other high-risk groups, such as patients living with HIV\/AIDS, absence or delay of parasitological diagnosis should not delay an immediate start of antimalarial treatment.  At present, molecular diagnostic tools based on nucleic-acid amplification techniques (e.g. loop-mediated isothermal amplification or PCR) do not have a role in the clinical management of malaria.  Where\u00a0 P. vivax \u00a0malaria is common and microscopy is not available, it is recommended that a combination RDT be used that allows detection of P. vivax (pLDH antigen from\u00a0 P. vivax ) or pan-malarial antigens (Pan-pLDH or aldolase).   Light microscopy   Microscopy not only provides a highly sensitive, specific diagnosis of malaria when performed well but also allows quantification of malaria parasites and identification of the infecting species. Light microscopy involves relatively high costs for training and supervision, and the accuracy of diagnosis is strongly dependent on the competence of the microscopist. Microscopy technicians may also contribute to the diagnosis of non-malarial diseases.  Although nucleic acid amplification-based tests are more sensitive, light microscopy is still considered the \u201cfield standard\u201d against which the sensitivity and specificity of other methods must be assessed. A skilled microscopist can detect asexual parasites at a density of &lt; 10 per \u00b5L of blood, but under typical field conditions, the limit of sensitivity is approximately 100 parasites per \u00b5L\u00a0   [94]   . This limit of detection approximates the lower end of the pyrogenic density range. Thus, microscopy provides good specificity for diagnosing malaria as the cause of a presenting febrile illness. More sensitive methods allow detection of an increasing proportion of cases of incidental parasitaemia in endemic areas, thus reducing the specificity of a positive test. Light microscopy has other important advantages:    low direct costs, if laboratory infrastructure to maintain the service is available; \t high sensitivity, if the performance of microscopy is high; \t differentiation of Plasmodia species; \t determination of parasite densities \u2013 notably identification of hyperparasitaemia; \t detection of gametocytaemia; \t allows monitoring of responses to therapy and \t can be used to diagnose many other conditions.    Good performance of microscopy can be difficult to maintain, because of the requirements for adequate training and supervision of laboratory staff to ensure competence in malaria diagnosis, electricity, good quality slides and stains, provision and maintenance of good microscopes and maintenance of quality assurance   [95]    and control of laboratory services [94][95]  Numerous attempts have been made to improve malaria microscopy, but none has proven to be superior to the classical method of Giemsa staining and oil-immersion microscopy for performance in typical health care settings   [96]        Rapid diagnostic tests    Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are immuno-chromatographic tests for detecting parasite-specific antigens in a finger-prick blood sample. Some tests allow detection of only one species ( P. falciparum ); others allow detection of one or more of the other species of human malaria parasites ( P. vivax ,  P. malariae  and  P. ovale )    [97]       [98]       [99]   . They are available commercially in various formats, e.g. dipsticks, cassettes and cards. Cassettes and cards are easier to use in difficult conditions outside health facilities. RDTs are relatively simple to perform and to interpret, and they do not require electricity or special equipment   [100]   .  Since 2012, WHO has recommended that RDTs should be selected in accordance with the following criteria, based on the results of the assessments of the  WHO Malaria RDT Product Testing programme     [101]   :    For detection of  P. falciparum  in all transmission settings, the panel detection score against  P. falciparum  samples should be at least 75% at 200 parasites\/\u00b5L. \t For detection of  P. vivax  in all transmission settings the panel detection score against  P. vivax  samples should be at least 75% at 200 parasites\/\u00b5L. \t The false positive rate should be less than 10%. \t The invalid rate should be less than 5%.    Current tests are based on the detection of histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2), which is specific for  P. falciparum , pan-specific or species-specific  Plasmodium  lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) or pan-specific aldolase. The different characteristics of these antigens may affect their suitability for use in different situations, and these should be taken into account in programmes for RDT implementation. The tests have many potential advantages, including:    rapid provision of results and extension of diagnostic services to the lowest-level health facilities and communities; \t fewer requirements for training and skilled personnel (for instance, a general health worker can be trained in 1 day); and \t reinforcement of patient confidence in the diagnosis and in the health service in general.    They also have potential disadvantages, including:    inability, in the case of  Pf HRP2-based RDTs, to distinguish new infections from recently and effectively treated infections, due to the persistence of  Pf HRP2 in the blood for 1\u20135 weeks after effective treatment; \t the presence in countries in the Amazon region of variable frequencies of HRP2 deletions in  P. falciparum  parasites, making HRP2-based tests not suitable in this region    [102]   ; \t poor sensitivity for detecting  P. malariae  and  P.ovale ; and \t the heterogeneous quality of commercially available products and the existence of lot-to-lot variation.    In a systematic review   [103]   , the sensitivity and specificity of RDTs in detecting  P. falciparum  in blood samples from patients in endemic areas attending ambulatory health facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria were compared with the sensitivity and specificity of microscopy or polymerase chain reaction. The average sensitivity of  Pf HRP2-detecting RDTs was 95.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93.5\u201396.2%), and the specificity was 95.2% (93.4\u201399.4%). RDTs for detecting  p LDH from  P. falciparum  are generally less sensitive and more specific than those for detecting HRP2, with an average sensitivity (95% CI) of 93.2% (88.0\u201396.2%) and a specificity of 98.5% (96.7\u201399.4%). Several studies have shown that health workers, volunteers and private sector providers can, with adequate training and supervision, use RDTs correctly and provide accurate malaria diagnoses. The criteria for selecting RDTs or microscopy can be found in the    WHO Recommended selection criteria for the procurement of malaria rapid diagnostic tests       [104]   .  Diagnosis with either microscopy or RDTs is expected to reduce overuse of antimalarial medicines by ensuring that treatment is given only to patients with confirmed malaria infection, as opposed to treating all patients with fever    [105]   . Although providers of care may be willing to perform diagnostic tests, they do not, however, always respond appropriately to the results. This is especially true when they are negative. It is therefore important to ensure the accuracy of parasite- based diagnosis and also to demonstrate this to users and to provide them with the resources to manage both positive and negative results adequately    [93]   .    Immunodiagnosis and nucleic acid amplification test methods    Detection of antibodies to parasites, which may be useful for epidemiological studies, is neither sensitive nor specific enough to be of use in the management of patients suspected of having malaria    [106]      Techniques to detect parasite nucleic acid, e.g. polymerase chain reaction and loop-mediated isothermal amplification, are highly sensitive and very useful for detecting mixed infections, in particular at low parasite densities that are not detectable by conventional microscopy or with RDTs. They are also useful for studies of drug resistance and other specialized epidemiological investigations    [107]   ; however, they are not generally available for large-scale field use in malaria- endemic areas, nor are they appropriate for routine diagnosis in endemic areas where a large proportion of the population may have low-density parasitaemia.  These techniques may be useful for population surveys and focus investigation in malaria elimination programmes.  At present, nucleic acid-based amplification techniques have no\u00a0role in the clinical management of malaria or in routine surveillance systems    [108]   ."},{"nid":704,"text_data":"5.2 Treating uncomplicated malaria    Definition of uncomplicated malaria   A patient who presents with symptoms of malaria and a positive parasitological test (microscopy or RDT) but with no features of severe malaria is defined as having uncomplicated malaria (see section 7.1 for definition of severe malaria). \u00a0   Therapeutic objectives   The clinical objectives of treating uncomplicated malaria are to cure the infection as rapidly as possible and to prevent progression to severe disease. \u201cCure\u201d is defined as elimination of all parasites from the body. The public health objectives of treatment are to prevent onward transmission of the infection to others and to prevent the emergence and spread of resistance to antimalarial drugs.     Incorrect approaches to treatment       Use of monotherapy   The continued use of artemisinins or any of the partner medicines alone will compromise the value of ACT by selecting for drug resistance.   As certain patient groups, such as pregnant women, may need specifically tailored combination regimens, single artemisinin derivatives will still be used in selected referral facilities in the public sector, but they should be withdrawn entirely from the private and informal sectors and from peripheral public health care facilities.   Similarly, continued availability of amodiaquine, mefloquine and SP as monotherapies in many countries is expected to shorten their useful therapeutic life as partner drugs of ACT, and they should be withdrawn wherever possible.     Incomplete\u00a0   dosing   In endemic regions, some semi-immune malaria patients are cured by an incomplete course of antimalarial drugs or by a treatment regimen that would be ineffective in patients with no immunity. In the past, this led to different recommendations for patients considered semi-immune and those considered non-immune. As individual immunity can vary considerably, even in areas of moderate-to-high transmission intensity, this practice is no longer recommended. A full treatment course with a highly effective ACT is required whether or not the patient is considered to be semi-immune.   Another potentially dangerous practice is to give only the first dose of a treatment course to patients with suspected but unconfirmed malaria, with the intention of giving the full treatment if the diagnosis is confirmed. This practice is unsafe, could engender resistance, and is not recommended.    Additional considerations for clinical management      Can the patient take oral medication?   Some patients cannot tolerate oral treatment and will require parenteral or rectal administration for 1\u20132 days, until they can swallow and retain oral medication reliably. Although such patients do not show other signs of severity, they should receive the same initial antimalarial treatments recommended for severe malaria. Initial rectal or parenteral treatment must always be followed by a full 3-day course of ACT. \u00a0   Use of antipyretics   In young children, high fevers are often associated with vomiting, regurgitation of medication and seizures. They are thus treated with antipyretics and, if necessary, fanning and tepid sponging. Antipyretics should be used if the core temperature is &gt; 38.5 \u00baC. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) at a dose of 15 mg\/kg bw every 4 h is widely used; it is safe and well tolerated and can be given orally or as a suppository. Ibuprofen (5 mg\/kg bw) has been used successfully as an alternative in the treatment of malaria and other childhood fevers, but, like aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, it is\u00a0 no longer recommended\u00a0 because of the risks of gastrointestinal bleeding, renal impairment and Reye\u2019s syndrome.     Use of anti-emetics   Vomiting is common in acute malaria and may be severe. Parenteral antimalarial treatment may therefore be required until oral administration is tolerated. Then a full 3-day course of ACT should be given. Anti-emetics are potentially sedative and may have neuropsychiatric adverse effects, which could mask or confound the diagnosis of severe malaria. They should therefore be used with caution.     Management of seizures   Generalized seizures are more common in children with\u00a0 P. falciparum\u00a0 malaria than in those with malaria due to other species. This suggests an overlap between the cerebral pathology resulting from falciparum malaria and febrile convulsions.\u00a0 As seizures may be a prodrome of cerebral malaria, patients who have more than two seizures within a 24 h period should be treated as for severe malaria. If the seizures continue, the airways should be maintained and anticonvulsants given (parenteral or rectal benzodiazepines or intramuscular paraldehyde). When the seizure has stopped, the child should be treated as indicated in section 7.10.5,\u00a0if his or her core temperature is &gt; 38.5 \u00baC. There is no evidence that prophylactic anticonvulsants are beneficial in otherwise uncomplicated malaria, and they are not recommended."},{"nid":705,"text_data":"5.3 Treating special risk groups  Several important patient sub-populations,including young children,pregnant women and patients taking potent enzyme inducers (e.g. rifampicin, efavirenz), have altered pharmacokinetics,resulting in sub-optimalexposure to antimalarialdrugs.This increases the rate of treatment failure with current dosage regimens. The rates of treatment failure are substantially higher in hyperparasitaemic patients and patients in areas with artemisinin-resistant falciparum malaria, and these groups require greater exposure to antimalarial drugs (longer duration of therapeutic concentrations) than is achieved with current ACT dosage recommendations. It is often uncertain how best to achieve this. Options include increasing individual doses, changing the frequency or duration of dosing, or adding an additional antimalarial drug. Increasing individual doses may not, however,achieve the desired exposure (e.g.lumefantrine absorption becomes saturated), or the dose may be toxic due to transiently high plasma concentrations (piperaquine, mefloquine, amodiaquine, pyronaridine). An additional advantage of lengthening the duration of treatment (by giving a 5-day regimen) is that it provides additional exposure of the asexual cycle to the artemisinin component as well as augmenting exposure to the partner drug. The acceptability, tolerability, safety and effectiveness of augmented ACT regimens in these special circumstances should be evaluated urgently.     Large and obese adults   Large adults are at risk for under-dosing when they are dosed by age or in standard pre-packaged adult weight-based treatments. In principle, dosing of large adults should be based on achieving the target mg\/kg bw dose for each antimalarial regimen. The practical consequence is that two packs of an antimalarial drug might have to be opened to ensure adequate treatment. For obese patients, less drug is often distributed to fat than to other tissues; therefore, they should be dosed on the basis of an estimate of lean body weight, ideal body weight. Patients who are heavy but not obese require the same mg\/kg bw doses as lighter patients.   In the past, maximum doses have been recommended, but there is no evidence or justification for this practice. As the evidence for an association between dose, pharmacokinetics and treatment outcome in overweight or large adults is limited, and alternative dosing options have not been assessed in treatment trials, it is recommended that this gap in knowledge be assessed urgently. In the absence of data, treatment providers should attempt to follow up the treatment outcomes of large adults whenever possible."},{"nid":706,"text_data":"5.4 Treating uncomplicated malaria caused by P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae or P. knowlesi 8    Plasmodium vivax\u00a0 accounts for approximately half of all malaria cases outside Africa\u00a0   [3]       [123]       [124]   . It is prevalent\u00a0in the Middle East, Asia, the Western Pacific and Central and South America. With the exception of the Horn, it is rarer in Africa, where there is a high prevalence of the Duffy-negative phenotype, particularly in West Africa, although cases are reported in both Mauritania and Mali\u00a0   [124]   . In most areas where\u00a0 P. vivax\u00a0 is prevalent, the malaria transmission rates are low (except on the island of New Guinea). Affected populations achieve only partial immunity to this parasite, and so people of all ages are at risk for\u00a0 P. vivax\u00a0 malaria\u00a0   [124]   . Where both\u00a0 P. \u00a0 falciparum\u00a0 and\u00a0 P.   \u00a0vivax\u00a0 are prevalent, the incidence rates of\u00a0 P.   \u00a0vivax\u00a0 tend to peak at a younger age than for\u00a0 P. falciparum . This is because each\u00a0 P. vivax\u00a0 inoculation may be followed by several relapses. The other human malaria parasite species,\u00a0 P. \u00a0 malariae\u00a0 and\u00a0 P. ovale\u00a0 (which is in fact two sympatric species), are less common.\u00a0 P. knowlesi , a simian parasite, causes occasional cases of malaria in or near forested areas of South-East Asia and the Indian subcontinent\u00a0   [125]   . In parts of the island of Borneo,\u00a0 P. knowlesi\u00a0 is the predominant cause of human malaria and an important cause of severe malaria   Of the six species of\u00a0 Plasmodium\u00a0 that affect humans, only\u00a0 P. vivax\u00a0 and the two species of\u00a0 P. ovale\u00a0   [126]     \u00a0form hypnozoites, which are dormant parasite stages in the liver that cause relapse weeks to years after the primary infection.\u00a0 P. vivax\u00a0 preferentially invades reticulocytes, and repeated illness causes chronic anaemia, which can be debilitating and sometimes life-threatening, particularly in young children\u00a0   [127]   . Recurrent vivax malaria is an important impediment to human and economic development in affected populations. In areas where\u00a0 P. falciparum\u00a0 and\u00a0 P. \u00a0 vivax\u00a0 co-exist, intensive malaria control often has a greater effect on\u00a0 P. falciparum , as\u00a0 P. vivax,\u00a0 is more resilient to interventions.   Although\u00a0 P. vivax\u00a0 has been considered to be a benign form of malaria, it may sometimes cause severe disease\u00a0   [128]   . The major complication is anaemia in young children. In Papua province, Indonesia\u00a0   [128]   , and in Papua New Guinea\u00a0   [129]   , where malaria transmission is intense,\u00a0 P. vivax\u00a0 is an important cause of malaria morbidity and mortality, particularly in young infants and children. Occasionally, older patients develop vital organ involvement similar to that in severe and complicated\u00a0 P. falciparum\u00a0 malaria\u00a0   [130]       [131]   . During pregnancy, infection with\u00a0 P. vivax , as with\u00a0 P. falciparum , increases the risk for abortion and reduces birth weight\u00a0   [132]       [121]   . In primigravidae, the reduction in birth weight is approximately two thirds that associated with\u00a0 P. falciparum.\u00a0 In one large series, this effect increased with successive pregnancies\u00a0   [132]   .    P. knowlesi\u00a0 is a zoonosis that normally affects long- and pig-tailed macaque monkeys. It has a daily asexual cycle, resulting in a rapid replication rate and high parasitaemia.\u00a0 P. knowlesi\u00a0 may cause a fulminant disease similar to severe falciparum malaria (with the exception of coma, which does not occur)\u00a0   [133]       [134]   . Co-infection with other species is common .      Diagnosis   Diagnosis of\u00a0 P. vivax ,\u00a0 P. ovale , and\u00a0 P. malariae\u00a0 malaria is based on microscopy.\u00a0 P. knowlesi\u00a0 is frequently misdiagnosed under the microscope, as the young ring forms are similar to those of\u00a0 P. falciparum , the late trophozoites are similar to those of\u00a0 P. malariae , and parasite development is asynchronous. Rapid diagnostic tests based on immunochromatographic methods are available for the detection of\u00a0 P. vivax\u00a0 malaria; however, they are relatively insensitive for detecting\u00a0 P. malariae\u00a0 and\u00a0 P. ovale\u00a0 parasitaemia. Rapid diagnostic antigen tests for human\u00a0 Plasmodium\u00a0 species show poor sensitivity for\u00a0 P .\u00a0 knowlesi\u00a0 infections in humans with low parasitaemia\u00a0   [135]   .    Treatment   The objectives of treatment of vivax malaria are twofold: to cure the acute blood stage infection and to clear hypnozoites from the liver to prevent future relapses. This is known as \u201cradical cure\u201d.     In areas with chloroquine-sensitive\u00a0 P. vivax     For chloroquine-sensitive vivax malaria, oral chloroquine at a total dose of 25 mg base\/kg bw is effective and well tolerated. Lower total doses are not recommended, as these encourage the emergence of resistance. Chloroquine is given at an initial dose of 10 mg base\/kg bw, followed by 10 mg\/kg bw on the second day and 5 mg\/kg bw on the third day. In the past, the initial 10-mg\/kg bw dose was followed by 5 mg\/kg bw at 6 h, 24 h and 48 h. As residual chloroquine suppresses the first relapse of tropical\u00a0 P. vivax\u00a0 (which emerges about 3 weeks after onset of the primary illness), relapses begin to occur 5\u20137 weeks after treatment if radical curative treatment with primaquine is not given.  ACTs are highly effective in the treatment of vivax malaria, allowing simplification (unification) of malaria treatment; i.e. all malaria infections can be treated with an ACT. The exception is artesunate + SP, where resistance significantly compromises its efficacy. Although good efficacy of artesunate + SP was reported in one study in Afghanistan, in several other areas (such as South-East Asia)\u00a0 P. vivax\u00a0 has become resistant to SP more rapidly than\u00a0 P. falciparum.\u00a0 The initial response to all ACTs is rapid in vivax malaria, reflecting the high sensitivity to artemisinin derivatives, but, unless primaquine is given, relapses commonly follow. The subsequent recurrence patterns differ, reflecting the elimination kinetics of the partner drugs. Thus, recurrences, presumed to be relapses, occur earlier after artemether + lumefantrine than after dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine or artesunate + mefloquine because lumefantrine is eliminated more rapidly than either mefloquine or piperaquine. A similar temporal pattern of recurrence with each of the drugs is seen in the\u00a0 P. vivax\u00a0 infections that follow up to one third of acute falciparum malaria infections in South-East Asia.     In areas with chloroquine-resistant\u00a0 P. vivax     ACTs containing piperaquine, mefloquine or lumefantrine are the recommended treatment, although artesunate + amodiaquine may also be effective in some areas.   In the systematic review of ACTs for treating\u00a0 P. vivax\u00a0 malaria, dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine provided a longer prophylactic effect than ACTs with shorter half-lives (artemether + lumefantrine, artesunate + amodiaquine), with significantly fewer recurrent parasitaemias during 9 weeks of follow-up (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.40\u20130.82, three trials, 1066 participants). The half-life of mefloquine is similar to that of piperaquine, but use of dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine in\u00a0 P. vivax\u00a0 mono-infections has not been compared directly in trials with use of artesunate + mefloquine.    Uncomplicated\u00a0     P. ovale     ,\u00a0     P.   \u00a0   malariae     \u00a0or\u00a0 P. knowlesi\u00a0 malaria   Resistance of\u00a0 P. ovale, P. malariae\u00a0 and\u00a0 P. knowlesi\u00a0 to antimalarial drugs is not well characterized, and infections caused by these three species are generally considered to be sensitive to chloroquine. In only one study, conducted in Indonesia, was resistance to chloroquine reported in\u00a0 P. malariae .   The blood stages of\u00a0 P. ovale ,\u00a0 P. malariae\u00a0 and\u00a0 P. knowlesi\u00a0 should therefore be treated with the standard regimen of ACT or chloroquine, as for vivax malaria.    Mixed malaria infections   Mixed malaria infections are common in endemic areas. For example, in Thailand, despite low levels of malaria transmission, 8% of patients with acute vivax malaria also have\u00a0 P. falciparum\u00a0 infections, and one third of acute\u00a0 P. falciparum\u00a0 infections are followed by a presumed relapse of vivax malaria (making vivax malaria the most common complication of falciparum malaria).   Mixed infections are best detected by nucleic acid-based amplification techniques, such as PCR; they may be underestimated with routine microscopy. Cryptic\u00a0 P. falciparum\u00a0 infections in vivax malaria can be revealed in approximately 75% of cases by RDTs based on the\u00a0 Pf HRP2 antigen, but several RDTs cannot detect mixed infection or have low sensitivity for detecting cryptic vivax malaria. ACTs are effective against all malaria species and so are the treatment of choice for mixed infections."},{"nid":707,"text_data":"5.5 Treating severe malaria  Mortality from untreated severe malaria (particularly cerebral malaria) approaches 100%. With prompt, effective antimalarial treatment and supportive care, the rate falls to 10\u201320% overall. Within the broad definition of severe malaria some syndromes are associated with lower mortality rates (e.g. severe anaemia) and others with higher mortality rates (e.g. acidosis). The risk for death increases in the presence of multiple complications.   Any patient with malaria who is unable to take oral medications reliably, shows any evidence of vital organ dysfunction or has a high parasite count is at increased risk for dying. The exact risk depends on the species of infecting malaria parasite, the number of systems affected, the degree of vital organ dysfunction, age, background immunity, pre-morbid, and concomitant diseases, and access to appropriate treatment. Tests such as a parasite count, haematocrit and blood glucose may all be performed immediately at the point of care, but the results of other laboratory measures, if any, may be available only after hours or days. As severe malaria is potentially fatal, any patient considered to be at increased risk should be given the benefit of the highest level of care available. The attending clinician should not worry unduly about definitions: the severely ill patient requires immediate supportive care, and, if severe malaria is a possibility, parenteral antimalarial drug treatment should be started without delay.    Definitions   Severe falciparum malaria:\u00a0\u00a0For epidemiological purposes, severe falciparum malaria \u00a0 is defined as one or more of the following, occurring in the absence of an identified alternative cause and in the presence of\u00a0 P. falciparum\u00a0 asexual parasitaemia.    Impaired consciousness: A Glasgow coma score &lt; 11 in adults or a Blantyre coma score &lt; 3 in children \t Prostration: Generalized weakness so that the person is unable to sit, stand or walk without assistance \t Multiple convulsions: More than two episodes within 24 h \t Acidosis: A base deficit of &gt; 8 mEq\/L or, if not available, a plasma bicarbonate level of &lt; 15 mmol\/L or venous plasma lactate \u2265 5 mmol\/L. Severe acidosis manifests clinically as respiratory distress (rapid, deep, laboured breathing). \t Hypoglycaemia: Blood or plasma glucose &lt; 2.2 mmol\/L (&lt; 40 mg\/dL) \t Severe malarial anaemia: Haemoglobin concentration \u2264 5 g\/dL or a haematocrit of \u2264 15% in children &lt; 12 years of age (&lt; 7 g\/dL and &lt; 20%, respectively, in adults) with a parasite count &gt; 10 000\/\u00b5L \t Renal impairment: Plasma or serum creatinine &gt; 265 \u00b5mol\/L (3 mg\/dL) or blood urea &gt; 20 mmol\/L \t Jaundice: Plasma or serum bilirubin &gt; 50 \u00b5mol\/L (3 mg\/dL) with a parasite count &gt; 100 000\/ \u00b5L \t Pulmonary oedema: Radiologically confirmed or oxygen saturation &lt; 92% on room air with a respiratory rate &gt; 30\/min, often with chest indrawing and crepitations on auscultation \t Significant bleeding: Including recurrent or prolonged bleeding from the nose, gums or venepuncture sites; haematemesis or melaena \t Shock: Compensated shock is defined as capillary refill \u2265 3 s or temperature gradient on leg (mid to proximal limb), but no hypotension. Decompensated shock is defined as systolic blood pressure &lt; 70 mm Hg in children or &lt; 80 mmHg in adults, with evidence of impaired perfusion (cool peripheries or prolonged capillary refill). \t Hyperparasitaemia : P. falciparum\u00a0 parasitaemia &gt; 10%    Severe vivax and knowlesi malaria:\u00a0defined as for falciparum malaria but with no parasite density thresholds.   Severe knowlesi malaria is defined as for falciparum malaria but with two differences:      P.\u00a0   knowlesi\u00a0 hyperparasitaemia: parasite density &gt; 100 000\/\u00b5L \t Jaundice and parasite density &gt; 20 000\/\u00b5L.      Therapeutic objectives   The main objective of the treatment of severe malaria is to prevent the patient from dying. Secondary objectives are prevention of disabilities and prevention of recrudescent infection.   Death from severe malaria often occurs within hours of admission to a hospital or clinic, so it is essential that therapeutic concentrations of a highly effective antimalarial drug be achieved as soon as possible. Management of severe malaria comprises mainly clinical assessment of the patient, specific antimalarial treatment, additional treatment and supportive care.     Clinical assessment    Severe malaria is a medical emergency. An open airway should be secured in unconscious patients and breathing and circulation assessed. The patient should be weighed or body weight estimated, so that medicines, including antimalarial drugs and fluids, can be given appropriately. An intravenous cannula should be inserted, and blood glucose (rapid test), haematocrit or haemoglobin, parasitaemia and, in adults, renal function should be measured immediately. A detailed clinical examination should be conducted, including a record of the coma score. Several coma scores have been advocated: the Glasgow coma scale is suitable for adults, and the simple Blantyre modification is easily performed in children. Unconscious patients should undergo a lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid analysis to exclude bacterial meningitis.   The degree of acidosis is an important determinant of outcome; the plasma bicarbonate or venous lactate concentration should be measured, if possible.\u00a0\u00a0 If facilities are available, arterial or capillary blood pH and gases should be measured in patients who are unconscious, hyperventilating or in shock. Blood should be taken for cross-matching, a full blood count, a platelet count, clotting studies, blood culture and full biochemistry (if possible). Careful attention should be paid to the patient\u2019s fluid balance in severe malaria in order to avoid over- or under-hydration. Individual requirements vary widely and depend on fluid losses before admission.  The differential diagnosis of fever in a severely ill patient is broad. Coma and fever may be due to meningoencephalitis or malaria. Cerebral malaria is not associated with signs of meningeal irritation (neck stiffness, photophobia or Kernig\u2019s sign), but the patient may be opisthotonic. As untreated bacterial meningitis is almost invariably fatal, a diagnostic lumbar puncture should be performed to exclude this condition. There is also considerable clinical overlap between septicaemia, pneumonia and severe malaria, and these conditions may coexist. When possible, blood should always be taken on admission for bacterial culture. In malaria-endemic areas, particularly where parasitaemia is common in young age groups, it is difficult to rule out septicaemia immediately in a shocked or severely ill obtunded child .\u00a0 In all such cases, empirical parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started immediately, together with antimalarial treatment.     Treatment of severe malaria   It is essential that full doses of effective parenteral (or rectal) antimalarial treatment be given promptly in the initial treatment of severe malaria. This should be followed by a full dose of effective ACT orally. Two classes of medicine are available for parenteral treatment of severe malaria: artemisinin derivatives (artesunate or artemether) and the cinchona alkaloids (quinine and quinidine). Parenteral artesunate is the treatment of choice for all severe malaria. The largest randomized clinical trials ever conducted on severe falciparum malaria showed a substantial reduction in mortality with intravenous or intramuscular artesunate as compared with parenteral quinine. The reduction in mortality was not associated with an increase in neurological sequelae in artesunate-treated survivors. Furthermore, artesunate is simpler and safer to use.     Pre-referral treatment options   See recommendation.     Adjustment of parenteral dosing in renal failure or hepatic dysfunction    The dosage of artemisinin derivatives does not have to be adjusted for patients with vital organ dysfunction. However quinine accumulates in severe vital organ dysfunction. If a patient with severe malaria has persisting acute kidney injury or there is no clinical improvement by 48 h, the dose of quinine should be reduced by one third, to 10 mg salt\/kg bw every 12 h. Dosage adjustments are not necessary if patients are receiving either haemodialysis or haemofiltration.     Follow-on treatment    The current recommendation of experts is to give parenteral antimalarial drugs for the treatment of severe malaria for a minimum of 24 h once started (irrespective of the patient\u2019s ability to tolerate oral medication earlier) or until the patient can tolerate oral medication, before giving the oral follow-up treatment.   After initial parenteral treatment, once the patient can tolerate oral therapy, it is essential to continue and complete treatment with an effective oral antimalarial drug by giving a full course of effective ACT (artesunate + amodiaquine, artemether + lumefantrine or dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine). If the patient presented initially with impaired consciousness, ACTs containing mefloquine should be avoided because of an increased incidence of neuropsychiatric complications. When an ACT is not available, artesunate + clindamycin, artesunate + doxycycline, quinine + clindamycin or quinine + doxycycline can be used for follow-on treatment. Doxycycline is preferred to other tetracyclines because it can be given once daily and does not accumulate in cases of renal failure, but it should not be given to children &lt; 8 years or pregnant women. As treatment with doxycycline is begun only when the patient has recovered sufficiently, the 7-day doxycycline course finishes after the artesunate, artemether or quinine course. When available, clindamycin may be substituted in children and pregnant women.     Continuing supportive care   Patients with severe malaria require intensive nursing care, preferably in an intensive care unit where possible. Clinical observations should be made as frequently\u00a0\u00a0 as possible and should include monitoring of vital signs, coma score and urine output. Blood glucose should be monitored every 4 h, if possible, particularly in unconscious patients.     Management of complications    Severe malaria is associated with a variety of manifestations and complications, which must be recognized promptly and treated as shown below. \u00a0 Immediate clinical management of severe manifestations and complications of\u00a0 P. falciparum\u00a0 malaria  a\u00a0It is assumed that appropriate antimalarial treatment will have been started in all cases. b\u00a0Prevent by avoiding excess hydration    Additional aspects of management   Fluid therapy Fluid requirements should be assessed individually. Adults with severe malaria are very vulnerable to fluid overload, while children are more likely to be dehydrated. The fluid regimen must also be adapted to the infusion of antimalarial drugs. Rapid bolus infusion of colloid or crystalloids is contraindicated. If available, haemofiltration should be started early for acute kidney injury or severe metabolic acidosis, which do not respond to rehydration. As the degree of fluid depletion varies considerably in patients with severe malaria, it is not possible to give general recommendations on fluid replacement; each patient must be assessed individually and fluid resuscitation based on the estimated deficit. In high-transmission settings, children commonly present with severe anaemia and hyperventilation (sometimes termed \u201crespiratory distress\u201d) resulting from severe metabolic acidosis and anaemia; they should be treated by blood transfusion. In adults, there is a very thin dividing line between over-hydration, which may produce pulmonary oedema, and under-hydration, which contributes to shock, worsening acidosis and renal impairment. Careful, frequent evaluation of jugular venous pressure, peripheral perfusion, venous filling, skin turgor and urine output should be made. \u00a0 Blood transfusion Severe malaria is associated with rapid development of anaemia, as infected, once infected and uninfected erythrocytes are haemolysed and\/or removed from the circulation by the spleen. Ideally, fresh, cross-matched blood should be transfused; however, in most settings, cross-matched virus-free blood is in short supply. As for fluid resuscitation, there are not enough studies to make strong evidence-based recommendations on the indications for transfusion; the recommendations given here are based on expert opinion. In high-transmission settings, blood transfusion is generally recommended for children with a haemoglobin level of &lt; 5 g\/100 mL (haematocrit &lt; 15%). In low-transmission settings, a threshold of 20% (haemoglobin, 7 g\/100 mL) is recommended. These general recommendations must, however, be adapted to the individual, as the pathological consequences of rapid development of anaemia are worse than those of chronic or acute anaemia when there has been adaptation and a compensatory right shift in the oxygen dissociation curve.  \u00a0Exchange blood transfusion Many anecdotal reports and several series have claimed the benefit of exchange blood transfusion in severe malaria, but there have been no comparative trials, and there is no consensus on whether it reduces mortality or how it might work. Various rationales have been proposed:    removing infected red blood cells from the circulation and therefore lowering the parasite burden (although only the circulating, relatively non-pathogenic stages are removed, and this is also achieved rapidly with artemisinin derivatives); \t rapidly reducing both the antigen load and the burden of parasite-derived toxins, metabolites and toxic mediators produced by the host; and \t replacing the rigid unparasitized red cells by more easily deformable cells, therefore alleviating microcirculatory obstruction.    Exchange blood transfusion requires intensive nursing care and a relatively large volume of blood, and it carries significant risks. There is no consensus on the indications, benefits and dangers involved or on practical details such as the volume of blood that should be exchanged. It is, therefore, not possible to make any recommendation regarding the use of exchange blood transfusion.   Concomitant use of antibiotics The threshold for administering antibiotic treatment should be low in severe malaria. Septicaemia and severe malaria are associated, and there is substantial diagnostic overlap,particularly in children in areas of moderate and high transmission.Thus broad- spectrum antibiotic treatment\u00a0 should   \u00a0   be given\u00a0 with antimalarial drugs to all children with suspected severe malaria in areas of moderate and high transmission until a bacterial infection is excluded. After the start of antimalarial treatment, unexplained deterioration may result from a supervening bacterial infection.Enteric bacteria (notably\u00a0 Salmonella ) predominated in many trial series in Africa, but a variety of bacteria have been cultured from the blood of patients with a diagnosis of severe malaria.   Patients with secondary pneumonia or with clear evidence of aspiration should be given empirical treatment with an appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic. In children with persistent fever despite parasite clearance, other possible causes of fever should be excluded, such as systemic\u00a0 Salmonella\u00a0 infections and urinary tract infections, especially in catheterized patients. In the majority of cases of persistent fever, however, no other pathogen is identified after parasite clearance. Antibiotic treatment should be based on culture and sensitivity results or,if not available, local antibiotic sensitivity patterns.   Use of anticonvulsants The treatment of convulsions in cerebral malaria with intravenous (or, if this is not possible, rectal) benzodiazepines or intramuscular paraldehyde is similar\u00a0\u00a0 to that for repeated seizures from any cause. In a large, double-blind, placebo- controlled evaluation of a single prophylactic intramuscular injection of 20 mg\/kg bw of phenobarbital to children with cerebral malaria, the frequency of seizures was reduced but the mortality rate was increased significantly. This resulted from respiratory arrest and was associated with additional use of benzodiazepine.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   A 20 mg\/kg bw dose of phenobarbital should not \u00a0 be given without respiratory support. It is not known whether a lower dose would be effective and safer or whether mortality would not increase if ventilation were given. In the absence of further information, prophylactic anticonvulsants are not recommended.  \u00a0Treatments that are not recommended\u00a0 In an attempt to reduce the high mortality from severe malaria, various adjunctive treatments have been evaluated, but none has proved effective and many have been shown to be harmful. Heparin, prostacyclin, desferroxamine, pentoxifylline, low- molecular-mass dextran, urea, high-dose corticosteroids, aspirin anti-TNF antibody, cyclosporine A,dichloroacetate, adrenaline, hyperimmune serum, N -acetylcysteine and bolus administration of albumin are not recommended.In addition,use of corticosteroids increases the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding and seizures and has been associated with prolonged coma resolution times when compared with placebo. \u00a0   Treatment of severe malaria during pregnancy   Women in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy are more likely to have severe malaria than other adults, and, in low-transmission settings, this is often complicated by pulmonary oedema and hypoglycaemia. Maternal mortality is approximately 50%, which is higher than in non-pregnant adults. Fetal death and premature labour are common. Parenteral antimalarial drugs should be given to pregnant women with severe malaria in full doses without delay. Parenteral artesunate is the treatment of choice in all trimesters. \u00a0 Treatment must not be delayed. If artesunate is unavailable, intramuscular artemether should be given, and if this is unavailable then parenteral quinine should be started immediately until artesunate is obtained.   Obstetric advice should be sought at an early stage, a paediatrician alerted and blood glucose checked frequently. Hypoglycaemia should be expected, and it is often recurrent if the patient is receiving quinine. Severe malaria may also present immediately after delivery. Postpartum bacterial infection is a common complication and should be managed appropriately.    Treatment of severe\u00a0 P. vivax \u00a0malaria   Although\u00a0 P. vivax\u00a0 malaria is considered to be benign, with a low case-fatality rate, it may cause a debilitating febrile illness with progressive anaemia and\u00a0 can also occasionally cause severe disease, as in\u00a0 P. falciparum\u00a0 malaria. Reported manifestations of severe\u00a0 P. vivax\u00a0 malaria include severe anaemia, thrombocytopenia, acute pulmonary oedema and, less commonly, cerebral malaria, pancytopenia, jaundice, splenic rupture, haemoglobinuria, acute renal failure and shock.   Prompt effective treatment and case management should be the same as for severe\u00a0 P. falciparum\u00a0 malaria (see  section 5.5.1 ). Following parenteral artesunate, treatment can be completed with a full treatment course of oral ACT or chloroquine (in countries where chloroquine is the treatment of choice). A full course of radical treatment with primaquine should be given after recovery.

National decision-making   National decision-makers are encouraged to adopt inclusive, transparent, rigorous approaches. Broad, inclusive stakeholder engagement in the design and implementation of national malaria control programmes will help to ensure they are feasible, appropriate, equitable and acceptable. Transparency and freedom from financial conflicts of interest will reduce mistrust and conflict, while rigorous evidence-based processes will ensure that the best possible decisions are made for the population.     Information required for national decision-making   Selection of first- and second-line antimalarial medicines will require reliable national data on their efficacy and parasite resistance, which in turn require that appropriate surveillance and monitoring systems are in place (see Monitoring efficacy and safety of antimalaria drugs). In some countries, the group adapting the guidelines for national use might have to re-evaluate the global evidence base with respect to their own context. The GRADE tables may serve as a starting-point for this assessment.  Decisions about coverage, feasibility, acceptability and cost may require input from various health professionals, community representatives, health economists, academics and health system managers.     Opportunities and risks   The recommendations made in these guidelines provide an opportunity to improve malaria case management further, to reduce unnecessary morbidity and mortality and to contribute to continued efforts towards elimination. Failure to implement the basic principles of combination therapy and rational use of antimalarial medicines will risk promoting the emergence and spread of drug resistance,\u00a0 which\u00a0 could undo all the recent gains in malaria control and elimination.      General guiding principles for choosing a case management strategy and tools     Choosing a diagnostic strategy The two methods currently considered suitable for routine patient management are light microscopy and RDTs. Different strategies may be adopted in different health care settings. The choice between RDTs and microscopy depends on local circumstances, including the skills available, the patient case-load, the epidemiology of malaria and use of microscopy for the diagnosis of other diseases. When the case-load of patients with fever is high, the cost of each microscopy test is likely to be less than that of an RDT; however, high-throughput, high-quality microscopy may be less operationally feasible. Although several RDTs allow diagnosis of both\u00a0 P. falciparum\u00a0 and\u00a0 P. vivax\u00a0 infections, microscopy has further advantages, including accurate parasite counting (and thus identification of high parasite density), prognostication in severe malaria, speciation of other malaria parasites and sequential assessment of the response to antimalarial treatment. Microscopy may help to identify other causes of fever. High-quality light microscopy requires well- trained, skilled staff, good staining reagents, clean slides and, often, electricity to power the microscope. It requires a quality assurance system, which is often not well implemented in malaria-endemic countries.   In many areas, malaria patients are treated outside the formal health services, e.g. in the community, at home or by private providers. Microscopy is generally not feasible in the community, but RDTs might be available, allowing access to confirmatory diagnosis of malaria and the correct management of febrile illnesses.  The average sensitivity of HRP2-detecting RDTs is generally greater than that of RDTs for detecting\u00a0 p LDH of\u00a0 P. falciparum , but the latter are slightly more specific because the HRP2 antigen may persist in blood for days or weeks after effective treatment. HRP2-detecting RDTs are not suitable for detecting treatment failure. RDTs are slightly less sensitive for detecting\u00a0 P. malariae\u00a0 and\u00a0 P. ovale.\u00a0 The WHO Malaria RDT Product Testing programme provides comparative data on the performance of RDT products to guide procurement. Since 2008, 210 products have been evaluated in five rounds of product testing\u00a0   [101]       [104]   .   For the diagnosis of severe malaria, microscopy is preferred, as it provides a diagnosis of malaria and assessment of other important parameters of prognostic relevance in severely ill patients (such as parasite count and stage of parasite development and intra-leukocyte pigment). In severe malaria, an RDT can be used to confirm malaria rapidly so that parenteral antimalarial treatment can be started immediately. Where possible, however, blood smears should be examined by microscopy, with frequent monitoring of parasitaemia (e.g. every 12 h) during the first 2\u20133 days of treatment in order to monitor the response. \u00a0 Choosing ACT In the absence of resistance, all the recommended ACTs have been shown to result in parasitological cure rates of &gt; 95%. Although there are minor differences in the oral absorption, bioavailability and tolerability of the different artemisinin derivatives, there is no evidence that these differences are clinically significant in currently available formulations. It is the properties of the partner medicine and the level of resistance to it that determine the efficacy of a formulation.   Policy-makers should also consider:    local data on the therapeutic efficacy of the ACT, \t local data on drug resistance, \t the adverse effect profiles of ACT partner drugs, \t the availability of appropriate formulations to ensure adherence, \t cost.    In parts of South-East Asia, artemisinin resistance is compromising the efficacy of ACTs and placing greater selection pressure on resistance to the partner medicines. Elsewhere, there is no convincing evidence for reduced susceptibility to the artemisinins; therefore, the performance of the partner drugs is the determining factor in the choice of ACT, and the following principles apply:    Resistance to mefloquine has been found in parts of mainland South-East\u00a0 Asia where this drug has been used intensively. Nevertheless, the combination with artesunate is very effective, unless there is also resistance to artemisinin.\u00a0Resistance to both components has compromised the efficacy of artesunate + mefloquine in western Cambodia, eastern Myanmar and eastern Thailand. \t Lumefantrine shares some cross-resistance with mefloquine, but this has not compromised its efficacy in any of the areas in which artemether + lumefantrine has been used outside South-East Asia. \t Until recently, there was no evidence of resistance to piperaquine anywhere, but there is now reduced susceptibility in\u00a0 western\u00a0 Cambodia.\u00a0 Elsewhere, the dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine combination is highly effective. \t Resistance to SP limits its use in combination with artesunate to the few areas in which susceptibility is retained. \t Amodiaquine remains effective in combination with artesunate in parts of Africa and the Americas, although elsewhere resistance to this drug was prevalent before its introduction in an ACT.\u00a0      Considerations in use of artemisinin-based combination therapy   Oral artemisinin and its derivatives (e.g. artesunate, artemether, dihydroartemisinin) should not be used alone. In order to simplify use, improve adherence and minimize the availability of oral artemisinin monotherapy, fixed-dose combination ACTs are strongly preferred to co-blistered or co-dispensed loose tablets and should be used when they are readily available. Fixed-dose combinations of all recommended ACT are now available, except artesunate + SP. Fixed-dose artesunate + amodiaquine performs better than loose tablets, presumably by ensuring adequate dosing. Unfortunately, paediatric formulations are not yet available for all ACTs.   The choice of ACT in a country or region should be based on optimal efficacy and adherence, which can be achieved by:    minimizing the number of formulations available for each recommended treatment regimen \t using, where available, solid formulations instead of liquid formulations, even for young patients.    Although there are some minor differences in the oral absorption and bioavailability of different artemisinin derivatives, there is no evidence that such differences in currently available formulations are clinically significant. It is the pharmacokinetic properties of the partner medicine and the level of resistance to it that largely determine the efficacy and choice of combinations. Outside South-East Asia, there is no convincing evidence yet for reduced susceptibility to the artemisinins; therefore, the performance of the partner drug is the main determinant in the choice of ACT, according to the following principles:    Drugs used in IPTp, SMC or chemoprophylaxis should not be used as first-line treatment in the same country or region. \t Resistance to SP limits use of artesunate + SP to areas in which susceptibility is retained.Thus, in the majority of malaria-endemic countries, first-line ACTs remain highly effective, although resistance patterns change over time and should be closely monitored.      Choosing among formulations \u00a0  Use of fixed-dose combination formulations will ensure strict adherence to the central principle of combination therapy. Monotherapies should not be used, except as parenteral therapy for severe malaria or SP chemoprevention, and steps should be taken to reduce and remove their market availability. Fixed-dose combination formulations are now available for all recommended ACTs except artesunate + SP.   Paediatric formulations should allow accurate dosing without having to break tablets and should promote adherence by their acceptability to children. Paediatric formulations are currently available for artemether + lumefantrine, dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine and artesunate + mefloquine. \u00a0   Other operational issues in managing effective treatment   Individual patients derive the maximum benefit from an ACT if they can access it within 24\u201348 h of the onset of malaria symptoms. The impact in reducing transmission at a population level depends on high coverage rates and the transmission intensity. Thus, to optimize the benefits of deploying ACTs, they should be available in the public health delivery system, the private sector and the community, with no financial or physical barrier to access. A strategy for ensuring full access (including community management of malaria in the context of integrated case management) must be based on analyses of national and local health systems and may require legislative changes and regulatory approval, with additional local adjustment as indicated by programme monitoring and operational research.\u00a0 To optimize the benefits of effective treatment, wide dissemination of national treatment guidelines, clear recommendations, appropriate information, education and communication materials, monitoring of the deployment process, access and coverage, and provision of adequately packaged antimalarial drugs are needed.   Community case management of malaria Community case management is recommended by WHO to improve access to prompt, effective treatment of malaria episodes by trained community members living as close as possible to the patients. Use of ACTs in this context is feasible, acceptable and effective\u00a0   [154]   . Pre-referral treatment for severe malaria with rectal artesunate and use of RDTs are also recommended in this context. Community case management should be integrated into community management of childhood illnesses, which ensures coverage of priority childhood illnesses outside of health facilities.  Health education From the hospital to the community, education is vital to optimizing antimalarial treatment. Clear guidelines in the language understood by local users, posters, wall charts, educational videos and other teaching materials, public awareness campaigns, education and provision of information materials to shopkeepers and other dispensers can improve the understanding of malaria. They will increase the likelihood of better prescribing and adherence, appropriate referral and reduce unnecessary use of antimalarial medicines.   Adherence to treatment Patient adherence is a major determinant of the response to antimalarial drugs, as most treatments are taken at home without medical supervision. Studies on adherence suggest that 3-day regimens of medicines such as ACTs are completed reasonably well, provided that patients or caregivers are given an adequate explanation at the time of prescribing or dispensing. Prescribers, shopkeepers and vendors should therefore give clear, comprehensible explanations of how to use the medicines. Co-formulation probably contributes importantly to adherence. User- friendly packaging (e.g. blister packs) also encourages completion of a treatment course and correct dosing."},{"nid":711,"text_data":"6 Elimination  Recommendations for Elimination are currently in development and are anticipated to be published in 2021. \u00a0 In 2017, WHO published\u00a0 A framework for malaria elimination \u00a0   [7]   \u00a0to provide guidance on the tools, activities, and dynamic strategies required to achieve interruption of transmission and to prevent re-establishment of malaria. It also describes the process for obtaining WHO certification of malaria elimination. The framework is meant to serve as a basis for national malaria elimination strategic plans and should be adapted to local contexts. \u00a0 The document emphasizes that all countries should work towards the goal of malaria elimination, regardless of the intensity of transmission. Countries should establish tools and systems that will allow them to reduce the disease burden (when and where transmission is high) and progress to elimination of malaria as soon as possible. While malaria elimination should be the ultimate goal for all malaria-endemic countries, the guidance given here is intended mostly for areas of low transmission that are progressing to zero.     Mass drug administration for elimination   In an analysis of 38 mass drug administration projects carried out since 1932\u00a0   [156]   , only one was reported to have succeeded in interrupting malaria transmission permanently. In this study, chloroquine, SP and primaquine were provided weekly to the small population of Aneityum Island in Vanuatu for 9 weeks before the rainy season, in combination with distribution of insecticide-treated nets\u00a0   [157]   .   There is considerable divergence of opinion about the benefits and risks of mass antimalarial drug administration. As a consequence, it has been little used in recent years; however, renewed interest in malaria elimination and the emerging threat of artemisinin resistance has been accompanied by reconsideration of mass drug administration as a means for rapidly eliminating malaria in a specific region or area. \u00a0 In the past, vivax elimination programmes were based on pre-seasonal mass radical treatment with primaquine (0.25 mg\/kg\/for 14 days) without testing for G6PD deficiency or monitoring primaquine-induced haemolysis, although in some cases interrupted regimens were used: 4 days\u2019 treatment, 3 days of no treatment, then continuation to complete the course (usually 11 days) if the drug was well tolerated\u00a0   [158]   .   Once mass drug administration is terminated, if malaria transmission is not interrupted or importation of malaria is not prevented, then malaria endemicity in the area will eventually return to its original levels (unless the vectorial capacity is reduced in parallel and maintained at a very low level). The time it takes to return to the original levels of transmission will depend on the prevailing vectorial capacity. If malaria is not eliminated from the target population,\u00a0 then mass drug administration may provide a significant selective pressure for the emergence of resistance. The rebound in malaria may be associated temporarily with higher morbidity and mortality if drug administration\u00a0 was\u00a0 maintained long enough for people to lose herd immunity against malaria.   For this reason, mass drug administration should not be started unless there is a good chance that focal elimination will be achieved. In some circumstances (e.g. containment of artemisinin-resistant\u00a0 P. falciparum ), elimination of only one species may be the objective."},{"nid":712,"text_data":"7 Surveillance  Surveillance is \u201cthe continuous and systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of disease-specific data, and the use of that data in the planning, implementation and evaluation of public health practice\u201d\u00a0   [159]   . \u00a0 Pillar 3 of the\u00a0   Global technical strategy for malaria 2016\u20132030   \u00a0   [4]   \u00a0is transformation of malaria surveillance into a key intervention in all malaria-endemic countries and in those countries that have eliminated malaria but remain susceptible to re-establishment of transmission.  Although surveillance guidance does not go through the GRADE process, it is the basis of operational activities in settings of any level of transmission and is included in these Guidelines as reference. The objective of surveillance is to support reduction of the burden of malaria, eliminate the disease and prevent its re-establishment. In settings in which transmission remains relatively high and the aim of national programmes is to reduce the burdens of morbidity and mortality, malaria surveillance is often integrated into broader routine health information systems to provide data for overall analysis of trends, stratification and planning of resource allocation. In settings in which malaria is being eliminated, the objectives of surveillance are to identify, investigate and eliminate foci of continuing transmission, prevent and cure infections and confirm elimination. After elimination has been achieved, its role becomes that of preventing re-establishment of malaria.  A malaria surveillance system comprises the people, procedures, tools and structures necessary to generate information on malaria cases and deaths. The information is used for planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating malaria programmes. An effective malaria surveillance system enables programme managers to:    identify and target areas and population groups most severely affected by malaria, to deliver the necessary interventions effectively and to advocate for resources; \t regularly assess the impact of intervention measures and progress in reducing the disease burden and help countries to decide whether adjustments or combinations of interventions are required to further reduce transmission;\t   detect and respond to epidemics in a timely way; \t\t provide relevant information for certification of elimination; and \t\t monitor whether the re-establishment of transmission has occurred and, if so, guide the response. \t      \u00a0Please refer to the WHO\u00a0   Malaria surveillance, monitoring &amp; evaluation: a reference manual   \u00a0   [29]   .    Subnational stratification   WHO has made guidance available on the strategic use of data to inform subnational stratification (see chapter 2 of\u00a0   WHO technical brief for countries preparing malaria funding requests for the Global Fund (2020-2022)   )\u00a0   [160]   .\u00a0 This guidance was developed in recognition of the increasing heterogeneity of malaria risk within countries as malaria control improves and the need to use problem-solving approaches to identify appropriate, context-specific packages of interventions to target different sub- populations. For example, case management should be accessible wherever there is a possibility of malaria cases seeking treatment. How the case management is delivered will vary according to factors such as health-seeking behavior, the accessibility and functioning of the public health infrastructure, availability of the private retail sector and the potential of community services. Local data are essential to complete the malaria stratification and select the optimal mixes of interventions. The guidance explains how to undertake a comprehensive multi-indicator stratification process to define sub-national intervention mixes that are optimized to achieve the strategic goals. As countries will rarely have all the resources they need to fully implement the ideal plan, a careful resource prioritization process is then required to maximise the impact of available resources. Prioritization should be based on the expected impact of interventions and consider value for money across the whole country, driven by local evidence."},{"nid":713,"text_data":"8 Methods  The consolidated\u00a0 WHO Guidelines for malaria \u00a0were prepared in accordance with WHO standards and methods for guideline development and originally published as the\u00a0 Guidelines for the treatment of malaria \u00a0(3rd\u00a0edition, 2015) and the\u00a0 Guidelines for malaria vector control \u00a0(1st\u00a0edition, 2019). Details of the approach can be found in the WHO\u00a0 Handbook for guideline development\u00a0     [1]   . Here we provide an overview of the standards, methods, processes and platforms applied \u00a0by GMP across the topics covered in this guideline\u00a0   [161]       [162]   .     Organization and process   The WHO guideline development process involved planning; conducting a \u201cscoping\u201d and needs assessment; establishing an internal WHO Guidelines Steering Group and an external Guidelines Development Group; formulating key recommendation questions using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) format; commissioning evidence reviews; applying GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology to assess the certainty of evidence; and using an Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) framework to take the GRADE results and contextual factors into account in developing recommendations. This methodology ensured\u00a0that the link between the evidence base and the recommendations was\u00a0transparent. The Guidelines were consolidated and will be continuously updated as new evidence becomes available in the online MAGICapp publication platform (www.magicapp.org) and published in user-friendly formats available on all electronic devices.     Technical leads in GMP established Guidelines Steering Groups\u00a0 for each technical area \u00a0 \u00a0to support the drafting of\u00a0the scope of the\u00a0Guidelines\u00a0and preparing the planning proposal, including formulating key questions, as well as suggesting potential members for the Guidelines Development Group (GDG). Technical leads then obtained\u00a0declarations of interest from GDG members, assessed these and oversaw the management of any potential conflicts of interest, as well as the finalization and submission of a planning proposal to the Guidelines Review Committee (GRC) for review and approval.     Guidelines Development Groups (GDGs), \u00a0external bodies of experts and stakeholders, were responsible for the\u00a0 development of the evidence-based recommendations contained in the\u00a0Guidelines. The specific tasks of the GDG included:    providing inputs on the scope of the\u00a0Guidelines; \t building on the work of the Guidelines Steering Group to finalize the key recommendation questions in PICO format; \t choosing and ranking priority outcomes to guide the evidence reviews and focus the recommendations; \t reviewing eligibility criteria for the inclusion of studies in the evidence reviews; \t providing input on appropriate measure of outcomes of interest to be included in evidence reviews; \t validating the list of included and excluded studies; \t reviewing the GRADE evidence profiles or other assessments of the certainty of evidence used to inform the recommendations; \t interpreting the evidence, considering the different factors included in the EtD, particularly the overall balance of benefits and harms; \t formulating recommendations, taking into account benefits, harms, values and preferences, feasibility, equity, acceptability, resource requirements and other factors, as appropriate; \t identifying methodological shortcomings and evidence gaps in the available body of evidence, and providing guidance on how to address these as part of future research; \t reviewing and approving the final recommendations prior to submission to the GRC; and \t contributing to the dissemination of the final recommendations.      Different GDGs were used\u00a0to develop the WHO Guidelines for malaria (see  Section 10 : Contributors and interests), each with experts in that particular field. The composition of each GDG was balanced according to geographical representation and gender. Potential interests are identified and managed appropriately within GMP(see section below). Membership included the following categories of stakeholders:    relevant technical experts (e.g., clinicians with relevant expertise; epidemiologists; entomologists) \t intended end-users (programme managers and health professionals responsible for adopting, adapting and implementing the\u00a0Guidelines) \t patients\u00a0and\/or other representatives from malaria-endemic countries.      In selecting the chair of each GDG, each Steering Group ensured that the individual had the content expertise, had\u00a0no conflicts of interest and was\u00a0able to approach the recommendations with an open mind, i.e., having no preconceptions about the final recommendations. Chairs of the GDGs and\/or members were sensitized in ensuring that equity, human rights, gender and social determinants were taken into consideration in efforts to improve public health outcomes.\u00a0     External Review Groups \u00a0(ExRGs) (see  Section 10 : Contributors and interests) for each technical area for malaria were identified by the respective Steering Group. Each external review group was composed of people interested in the subject of the Guidelines and included members of the MPAG and individuals affected by or interested in the recommendations, such as technical experts, end-users, programme managers, advocacy groups and funders.\u00a0 The ExRG reviewed the draft guideline prior to its submission to the GRC for approval. The role of the group was to identify any errors or missing evidence and to provide comment on clarity, context-specific issues, and implications for implementation. The group was not expected to change the recommendations formulated by the GDG. For those cases where major concerns related to the recommendations were raised by the external reviewers, these were taken back to the GDG for discussion. Comments from external reviewers were incorporated into the revised Guidelines as appropriate. The final drafts were circulated to the GDG.     Guideline methodologists   Experts in guideline development processes complemented the technical expertise of the GDG members. Different methodologists supported the development of recommendations and guidance for each technical area.\u00a0Methodologists were identified by the Steering Groups based on their experience, ensuring they had expertise in the prioritization of questions and outcomes, evidence synthesis, GRADEing of evidence, the translation of evidence into recommendations and guideline development processes. The methodologists supported the planning, scoping and the development of key questions and assisted the GDG to formulate evidence-informed recommendations in a transparent and explicit manner. The methodologist served as the methodological co-chairs of some GDG meetings. \u00a0   Evidence synthesis methods   Following the initial GDG meeting, existing systematic reviews already published were identified or new systematic reviews were commissioned to systematically assess the certainty of the evidence for each priority question across the guideline topics. \u00a0  The reviews involved\u00a0extensive searches for published and unpublished trials using highly sensitive searches of established registers such as the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group trials register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE\u00ae, Embase and LILACS. Types of outcome measures for consideration in the evidence reviews included: rate of all-cause child mortality; rate of severe malaria episodes; rate of clinical malaria; rate of uncomplicated episodes of\u00a0 P. falciparum\u00a0 illness;\u00a0parasite prevalence (also specifically\u00a0 P. falciparum\u00a0 and\u00a0 P. vivax\u00a0 prevalence); anaemia prevalence; and, in the case of vector control interventions, entomological inoculation rate (EIR); density of immature vector stages; number of larval sites positive for immature vector stages. Harms and undesirable\u00a0\u00a0outcomes such as adverse events, development of antimalarial drug resistance,\u00a0reduced use of other malaria interventions or changes in mosquito behaviour were also assessed, where appropriate, to permit determination of the balance of benefits and harms.\u00a0Epidemiological outcomes, namely, demonstration that an intervention had proven protective efficacy to reduce, prevent or eliminate infection and\/or disease in humans, were prioritized over entomological outcomes, given that the correlation between the effect of interventions on entomological outcomes and the effect of interventions on public health outcomes has not been well established. Depending on the question posed, outcomes may be measured at the individual and\/or community level. The specific search methods, inclusion criteria, data collection and analysis plans for each evidence review were detailed in the published review protocols. Systematic review teams were\u00a0encouraged to publish their protocols in an online register of systematic reviews and to write their final reports using the 2020 PRISMA reporting guidelines.    When limited evidence was available from randomized trials, some\u00a0systematic reviews included non-randomized studies such as\u00a0quasi-experimental designs, including controlled before-and-after studies, interrupted time series (controlled and uncontrolled), and stepped wedge designs. As per WHO guidelines, the GDG also considered systematically collected evidence on contextual factors to develop the EtD Frameworks. The GDGs used GRADEPro software and\/or the MAGICappplatform, and the interactive EtD Framework to assist in the process of evidence review and recommendation-setting. \u00a0 The Evidence-to-Decision Framework considered several criteria to arrive at a recommendation for or against an intervention; these were\u00a0   [163]   :    How substantial are the desirable anticipated effects? \t How substantial are the undesirable anticipated effects? \t What is the overall certainty of the evidence of effects? \t Is there important uncertainty about or variability in how much people value the main outcomes? \t How large are the resource requirements (costs)? \t Does the cost-effectiveness of the intervention favour the intervention or the comparison? \t What would be the impact on health equity? \t Is the intervention acceptable to key stakeholders? \t Is the intervention feasible to implement?    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While criteria 1-4 relate to the health effects of recommendations, criteria 5-9 relate to contextual factors. In some cases, the GDG opted\u00a0to omit factors or add factors as deemed relevant. Recommendations formulated before 2021 may not have included assessment of all factors. The Evidence-to-Decision Framework summaries for each of the recommendations contained in the WHO Guidelines for malaria are presented in a tab below the recommendation alongside the GRADE tables in the evidence profile tab. \u00a0   Certainty of evidence   The certainty of evidence in the systematic reviews was rated for each outcome using a four-level categorization (Table 1). The certainty of evidence considered the study design, factors that would lead to rating down the certainty (the risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision of the effect estimates, and publication bias) as well as factors that would lead to rating up the certainty (large effect size and dose-response effect). The terms used in the certainty assessments referred to the level of certainty in the estimate of effect relative to the recommendation question, and not necessarily to the scientific quality of the investigations reviewed.    Formulation of recommendations   The systematic reviews, GRADE tables and other relevant materials were\u00a0provided to all members of the GDG prior to meeting to discuss particular key questions. Recommendations were formulated after considering the criteria included in the Evidence-to-Decision Framework listed above. Values and preferences were taken into account through discussions on the relative value beneficiaries place on the outcomes of the intervention.\u00a0Given that contextual factors are important in setting national policies and are broadly considered in the recommendation formulation process, efforts were made to collect information about these factors in preparation for the GDG meeting. This was achieved through systematic reviews of the literature, survey of stakeholders, or directly from the GDG.\u00a0Expanded evidence-based recommendations on resource implications for malaria interventions, deployed singularly or in combination, is a focus of ongoing work and guidance and will be developed where possible and incorporated into the\u00a0Guidelines.   After reviewing and judging the different criteria, the GDG discussed and reached a consensus on the final recommendation at in-person\u00a0or online meetings,\u00a0or through e-mail correspondence.\u00a0Typically, the GDG was presented with a \u2018neutral\u2019 recommendation and decided\u00a0on its direction and strength. The guideline development process aimed\u00a0to generate group consensus through open and transparent discussion. In some cases, anonymous \u00a0voting was used for judging the different criteria and developing the final recommendation to reduce peer pressure. Voting was used \u00a0as a starting point to build consensus or to reach a final decision when no consensus\u00a0was reached.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Types of guidance   Two types of guidance were presented in the\u00a0Malaria Guidelines.    GRADEd recommendations: These recommendations were formulated by a GDG using the GRADE approach, supported by systematic reviews of the evidence, with formal assessment of the certainty of evidence. \t Good practice statements: These statements reflect a consensus among a GDG that the net benefits of adherence to the statement were large and unequivocal, and that the implications of the statement were common sense. These statements were usually\u00a0not supported by a systematic review of evidence. In some cases, good practice statements were taken or adapted from existing recommendations or guidance initially developed through broad consultation, such as through the WHO Technical Expert Group on Malaria Vector Control (VCTEG) or Malaria Policy Advisory Group (MPAG) \u2013 previously the Malaria Policy Advisory Committee (MPAC). These statements are made to reinforce the basic principles of good management practice for implementation.        Strength of recommendations   Each intervention recommendation was classified as strong or conditional, according to the GRADE system\u00a0   [164]   . A strong recommendation\u00a0is one for which the GDG was confident that the desirable effects of adhering to the recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects.\u00a0A conditional recommendation\u00a0is one for which the GDG concluded that the desirable effects of adhering to the recommendation probably outweighed the undesirable effects but the GDG was not confident about these trade-offs. The reasons that favoured making a conditional recommendation included a \ufefflower certainty evidence; variability or uncertainty in the values and preferences of individuals regarding the outcomes of interventions; a tight balance between benefits and harms; high costs; equity related concerns, feasibility issues, and acceptability issues. The implications of strong and conditional recommendations for various groups are given in\u00a0Table\u00a02.    Presentation of evidence and recommendations   For clarity, the recommendations are presented in individual boxes on the MAGICapp platform with colour-coded strength of recommendations and labelled by strength based on the evidence reviewed. More information is available through expanding the tabs directly below the recommendation:\u00a0 the research evidence; the Evidence to Decision table; the justification including remarks from the GDG; practical information including dosing and contextual factors; and related references. Details about the evidence can be found by clicking on the Outcomes included in the evidence (e.g. Summary of Findings tables show sources for estimates of effect).\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0   Management of conflicts of interest   All members of the guideline development groups were requested to make declarations of interests, which were managed in accordance with WHO procedures and summarized at the beginning of each meeting to all participants. \u00a0Where necessary, GDG members may have been excluded from the discussion and\/or decision-making for topics for which they had declared interests. The members of the GDGs and a summary of declarations of interest are listed in  Section 10 : Contributors and Interests.     Link to WHO prequalification   When a recommendation is linked to the introduction of a new tool or product, there is a parallel process managed by the WHO Prequalification team to ensure that diagnostics, medicines, vaccines and vector control products meet global standards of quality, safety and efficacy, in order to optimize use of health resources and improve health outcomes. The prequalification process consists of a transparent, scientifically sound assessment, which includes dossier review, consistency testing or performance evaluation and site visits to manufacturers. This information, in conjunction with other procurement criteria, is used by UN and other procurement agencies in make purchasing decisions regarding these health products.. This parallel process aims to ensure that recommendations are linked to prequalified products and that prequalified products are linked to a recommendation for their use."},{"nid":714,"text_data":"9 Glossary  Please also refer to the    WHO malaria terminology       [164]    for additional information and notes on the glossary contained here.

WHO was of the opinion that these declarations did not constitute conflicts of interest and that the considered experts could participate in the consultations on the Guidelines subject to the public disclosure of their interests, which was conducted.   The relevant declared interests are summarized as follows:   Dr T. Burkot reported several potential conflicts of interest related to consulting payments, research support and non-monetary support, as follows: 1) consulting with Intellectual Ventures Global Good Fund (IVGGF), the non-profit arm of Intellectual Ventures Laboratory. Work was conducted from October 2014 to March 2015 through James Cook University; 2) consulting with IVGGF for a secondment in 2017 to develop a vector control strategy on mosquitoproof housing and methods to age-grade mosquitoes through James Cook University; 3) consulting with the non-profit Programme for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) in 2017 to support grant applications to evaluate new vector control tools in Africa; 4) consulting with IVGGF from 2017 to February 2018 to provide technical support on developing guidelines for testing new vector control strategies paid directly to Dr Burkot; 5) consulting with PATH from 2017 to February 2018 to provide technical advice on field trials for mosquito-proof housing products paid directly to Dr Burkot; 6) research support in a supervisory role provided to James Cook University for evaluation of a new malaria diagnostic test from October 2015 to March 2017; 7) research support in a supervisory role provided to James Cook University to undertake a malaria serologic survey in the Solomon Islands until June 2018; and, 8) non-monetary support to Vestergaard in a supervisory role to evaluate the impact of insecticide netting on malaria in Solomon Islands   Dr M. Coetzee reported a potential conflict of interest related to a family member\u2019s consulting work with AngloGold Ashanti in 2016 to carry out mosquito surveys and determine insecticide resistance in order to inform vector control strategies by gold mining companies in Africa. \u00a0 Professor M. Coosemans reported receiving a grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation for studying the impact of repellents for malaria prevention in Cambodia and also reported receiving repellent products for the study from SC Johnson for work conducted in 2012\u20132014. He also reported receiving six grants for the evaluation of public health pesticides from WHOPES since 2007, some of which will continue until 2018. \u00a0 Dr J. Hii reported receiving remuneration for consulting services from WHO and from the Ministry of Health of Timor-Leste for work conducted in 2017. He reported holding a grant from SC Johnson that ceased in 2017 for the evaluation of transfluthrin, and receiving travel and accommodation support from Bayer Crop Science to attend the 4th Bayer Vector Control Expert Meeting in 2017. He reported holding a WHO\/TDR research grant that focused on studying the magnitude and identifying causes for residual transmission in Thailand and Viet Nam (completed in 2018), and reported a plan to study the impact of socio-ecological systems and resilience (SESR)-based strategies on dengue vector control in schools and neighbouring household communities in Cambodia, which in November 2017 was awaiting ethical approval.

The declared interests, as per WHO regulations, were assessed by the WHO Secretariat with support from the Office of Compliance, Risk Management and Ethics as needed.   The relevant declared interests for the GDG are summarized as follows:   LUCY TUSTING: It was determined that Dr Tusting could participate in all parts of the meeting except for decision-making with respect to recommendations related to housing improvements.   The relevant declared interests for the ExRG are summarized as follows:   UMBERTO D\u2019ALLESSANDRO: the declared interests regarding the renumeration for acting on the advisory board, travel and the value of the donated drugs were considered financially significant, however the subject of these interests are not related to the topics of the review. The projects associated with housing modifications or improvements (2 to 4) are related to the subject of discussion. However, as the remit of the ERG is limited to identifying factual errors, providing clarity and to comment on implications for implementation -not to change the recommendations formulated by the GDG - it was concluded that his contributions would be valuable given his vast field experience.   JENNIFER ARMISTEAD: The declared interests were considered financially significant. Projects 1 and 2 are not related to the subject of the review, and the 4th\u00a0project evaluates larviciding which, although part of larval source management, is not an intervention for which revisions are being made in the vector control guidelines. The project associated with housing modifications (3) is related to the subject of discussion.\u00a0 However, as reviewers are not asked to change the meaning of the recommendations themselves, it was concluded that her contributions would be valuable particularly in commenting on uptake of the recommendations as she has vast field implementation experience.   MAUREEN COETZEE: The declared interests regarding the funding provided were considered financially significant. Project 3 investigated housing characteristics that were associated with risk of mosquito biting but did not evaluate the impact of housing modifications on malaria. Given her vast field experience, it was concluded that her review of the vector control guidelines would be valuable especially in commenting on implications for implementation.   CAROLINE JONES: Endectocides and vaccines are not topics of discussion for this review and so these projects are not considered a potential conflict of interest. The second project above aims to investigate the factors limiting the efficacy of current tools to prevent malaria, largely insecticide-treated nets, and identify the most cost effective, complementary interventions that would drive malaria transmission towards zero. This project could consider interventions under discussion by the ExRG but does not seek to systematically evaluate a particular tool. The third project is linked to one of the subjects being discussed as part of the review.\u00a0 As with Prof D\u2019Alessandro and Prof Coetzee, because the review is limited to identifying factual errors and commenting on clarity and implementation of the recommendations, it was felt that Dr Jones can provide useful insight regarding factors to be considered associated with gender and social determinants, equity, and human rights.   NEIL LOBO: The declared interests regarding the funding provided and provision of research materials were considered financially significant. None of the projects where companies had provided support were deemed to be related to the subject of the review. Only the topic of research project 7, \u2018Screening mosquito entry points into houses with novel long lasting insecticidal netting to reduce indoor vector densities and mitigate pyrethroid resistance\u2019 was considered to be related to the subject of the review.\u00a0 As the ExRG will not be asked to comment on the recommendations themselves, rather just ensure the wording is clear, accurate and supports uptake by end-users, it was felt that Prof Lobo would provide useful review given his vast experience working with national programmes.   MELANIE RENSHAW: Whilst the amount received was deemed significant, the nature of her work does not address the topics under review specifically so does not represent a conflict of interest."},{"nid":717,"text_data":"10.2 Guidelines for the treatment of malaria  Since the first and second editions of the guidelines were issued in 2006 and 2010, respectively, WHO methods for preparing guidelines have continued to evolve. The\u00a0third edition of the\u00a0 Guidelines for the treatment of malaria\u00a0 was prepared in accordance with the updated WHO standard methods for guideline development\u00a0   [1]   . This involved planning, \u201cscoping\u201d and needs assessment, establishment of a guidelines development group, formulation of key questions (PICO questions: population, participants or patients; intervention or indicator; comparator or control; outcome), commissioning reviews, Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and making recommendations. This method ensures a transparent link between the evidence and the recommendations. The GRADE system is a uniform, widely adopted approach based on explicit methods for formulating and evaluating the strength of recommendations for specific clinical questions on the basis of the robustness of the evidence.   The Technical Guidelines Development Group, co-chaired by Professor Fred Binka and Professor Nick White (other participants are listed below), organized a technical consultation on preparation of the third edition of the\u00a0 Guidelines.\u00a0 Declarations of conflicts of interest were received from all participants.\u00a0A WHO guideline steering group facilitated the scoping meeting, which was convened in February 2013, to set priorities and identify which sections of the second edition of\u00a0 Guidelines\u00a0 were to be reviewed and to define potential new recommendations. Draft PICO questions were formulated for collation and review of the evidence. A review of data on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics was considered necessary to support dose recommendations, and a subgroup was formed for this purpose.   After the scoping meeting, the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in Liverpool, England, was commissioned to undertake systematic reviews and to assess the quality of the evidence for each priority question. The reviews involved extensive searches for published and unpublished reports of trials and highly sensitive searches of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group trials register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE\u00ae, Embase and LILACS. All the reviews have been published on line in the Cochrane Library. When insufficient evidence was available from randomized trials, published reviews of non-randomized studies were considered.   The subgroup on dose recommendations reviewed published studies from MEDLINE\u00ae and Embase on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimalarial medicines. For analyses of pharmacokinetics and simulations of dosing, they used raw clinical and laboratory data from the Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network on the concentrations of antimalarial agents in plasma or\u00a0whole blood measured with validated assays in individual patients. The data had either been included in peer-reviewed publications or been submitted to regulatory authorities for drug registration. Population pharmacokinetics models were constructed, and the plasma or whole blood concentration profiles of antimalarial medicines were simulated (typically 1000 times) for different weight categories.   The guideline development group met in two technical meetings, in November 2013 and June 2014, to develop and finalize recommendations based on the GRADE tables constructed on the basis of answers to the PICO questions. The Guidelines \u00a0 were written by a subcommittee of the group. At various times during preparation of the guidelines, sections of the document or recommendations were reviewed by external experts and users who were not members of the group; these external peer reviewers are listed below.\u00a0Treatment recommendations were agreed by consensus, supported by systematic reviews and review of information on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

These were discussed extensively by the committee. Although it was considered that none of the declared interests had direct relevance to the deliberations or recommendations of the meeting, the panel members with declared interests were excluded from the subcommittees on GRADE and recommendations and the drafting group. The declared interests, as per WHO regulations, was cleared through the Legal Department of WHO. \u00a0 Dr K.

There were no monetary benefits and no conflicts with the subject of this review.   Professor N. White reported being an advisor to all pharmaceutical companies developing new antimalarial medicines. This is done on a pro-bono basis, it does not include consultancy fees or any form of remuneration."},{"nid":718,"text_data":"4.1.1 - Interventions recommended for large-scale deployment   Interventions that are recommended for large-scale deployment in terms of malaria vector control are those that\u00a0have proven protective efficacy to reduce or prevent infection and\/or disease in humans and are broadly applicable for populations at risk of malaria in most epidemiological and ecological settings.   Vector control interventions applicable for all populations at risk of malaria in most epidemiological and ecological settings are: i) deployment of ITNs that are prequalified by WHO, and ii) IRS with a product prequalified by WHO. The exception to this is DDT, which has not been prequalified. This insecticide may be used for IRS if no equally effective and efficient alternative is available, and if it is used in line with the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants\u00a0   [32]   . Between 2000 and 2015, 78% of the clinical malaria cases averted was attributed to insecticidal vector control, namely through the widespread scale-up of ITNs and IRS\u00a0   [14]   .   Programmatic targets against malaria, as detailed within national strategic plans, should be used to guide the decision-making process to assemble context-appropriate intervention packages. Decision-making around the intervention mix to deploy and the coverage level of each intervention needs to consider available local data to guide the stratification of interventions, the available funding, the relative cost-effectiveness of available intervention options, the resources required to provide access within the broader context of UHC, the feasibility of deploying the intervention(s) at the desired coverage level, and the country's strategic goal. The resulting\u00a0'optimal'\u00a0coverage of the components of an intervention package for a given geographical area will also depend on other site-specific factors such as past and present transmission intensity, past and present intervention coverage, acceptability, and equity of access\/use.   For malaria vector control interventions recommended for large-scale deployment namely, ITNs and IRS, optimal coverage refers to providing populations at risk of malaria with access to ITNs coupled with health promotion to maximize use, and ensuring timely replacement; or providing these populations with regular application of IRS. Either intervention should be deployed at a level that provides the best value for money while reflecting programmatic realities. In practice, this often means quantifying of commodities to provide full access by the population at risk while realizing that this will not result in 100% coverage or 100% access due to various systems\u00a0inefficiencies. Being cognizant of such constraints, decision-making should then consider other alternatives as part of the intervention package, ranging from chemoprevention to supplementary vector control, instead of pursuing the idealistic goal of providing full population coverage.\u00a0     Insecticide-treated nets   WHO recommends ITNs \u2013 which in many settings are pyrethroid-only LLINs \u2013 for use in protecting populations at risk of malaria, including in areas where malaria has been eliminated but the risk of reintroduction remains. An ITN repels, disables and\/or kills mosquitoes that come into contact with the insecticide on the netting material in addition to providing a physical barrier, thereby protecting the individual user. In addition, some studies have indicated that ITNs produce a \u201ccommunity effect\u201d, which means that when enough ITNs are being used in a community, the survival of the mosquito population as a whole is affected; this effect increases the protection against malaria for ITN users and extends protection to members of the community who do not sleep under an ITN\u00a0   [33]       [34]       [35]       [36]       [37]   . However, such a community effect has not been observed in all settings\u00a0   [38]       [39]       [40]   . WHO GMP commissioned a review to examine the evidence for a community effect and to investigate the biological mechanisms by which ITNs provide both personal- and community-level protection against malaria. The review also investigated what factors may determine the presence of a community effect and moderate its intensity (Paintain &amp; Lines, unpublished findings). \u00a0 The review concluded that a community effect does occur in the majority of settings, and that its extent is driven by a number of contextual factors. These factors include vector behaviour (particularly the extent of anthropophily, i.e., the propensity to feed on people, and endophagy, i.e., the tendency of mosquitoes to blood-feed indoors); the relative availability of human and non-human hosts in the locality; the level of ITN coverage and use in a community; the insecticide used (its residual insecticidal activity and repellency); and the resistance of the local malaria vectors, both physiological and behavioural, to the insecticide on the net. \u00a0 The ITN coverage threshold for when the community effect becomes apparent depends on a large number of contextual factors. Regardless of the context-dependent starting threshold, the extent of the community-level protection increases as ITN coverage and net use in a given community increases. \u00a0Because ITNs kill insecticide-susceptible mosquitoes that come into contact with the insecticide on the netting material, more mosquitoes will be killed as ITN coverage increases. This killing effect reduces both mosquito population density and mosquito longevity, resulting in fewer malaria vectors overall and a lower infectivity rate as fewer mosquitoes will survive the time it takes for the malaria parasite to develop in the mosquito. Consequently, the reduced density, age and proportion of the local mosquito population that is infective offer an additional level of protection to the community as a whole beyond the individual protection provided by ITNs.\u00a0 \u00a0 Large-scale field trials\u00a0   [37]       [41]   \u00a0and transmission models\u00a0   [42]       [43]   \u00a0originally suggested that community coverage (i.e., the proportion of human population using an ITN with effective insecticide treatments each night) of \u2265 50% is expected to result in some level of community-wide protection. The WHO-commissioned review indicated that this area-wide protection may start to occur at lower coverage levels (Paintain &amp; Lines, unpublished findings). The review modelled the short-term effect of increasing ITN coverage on the EIR (infectious bites per person per year) in an area with high malaria transmission and an insecticide susceptible, anthropophilic vector, assuming fixed human infectiousness. In the coverage range of 15% to 85%, an additional 20% increase in coverage of the human population at risk was shown to result in a reduction in malaria transmission intensity of approximately 50% (these findings are taken from the report submitted to WHO; findings may be revised if indicated by peer review). Additional ITN coverage is always beneficial in terms of providing more protection to individuals \u2013 both users and non-users of ITNs \u2013 and, conversely, any reduction in coverage may result in increased malaria transmission. However, there may be diminishing marginal returns to increasing coverage at higher levels. In terms of absolute cases of malaria averted, a reduction in malaria transmission when increasing ITN coverage from 80% to 100% \u200bmay not generate the same impact as a 20% increase in coverage at lower levels of coverage; the marginal costs required to increase coverage at high levels (&gt;80%) will also increase due to growing system inefficiencies. At\u00a0the country level, these diminishing returns must be balanced against potential investments in other cost-effective malaria prevention and control activities by means of a well-informed prioritization process.   Three main ITN classes are recognized\u00a0aby WHO as given below. These classes are formally established once public health value by a first-in-class product has been demonstrated:    ITNs designed to kill host-seeking insecticide-susceptible mosquito populations that have demonstrated public\u00a0health value compared to untreated nets and whose entomological effects consist of killing and reducing the blood-feeding of insecticide-susceptible mosquito vectors. This intervention class covers pyrethroid-only nets prequalified by WHO\u00a0and conventionally treated nets that rely on periodic re-treatment with a WHO prequalified self-treatment kit. Public health value has been demonstrated for products within this class and WHO recommends use of pyrethroid-only nets prequalified by WHO for large scale deployment. \t ITNs designed to kill host-seeking insecticide-resistant mosquitoes and for which a first-in-class product demonstrates public health value compared to the epidemiological impact of pyrethroid-only nets. This class includes nets that are treated with a pyrethroid insecticide and a synergist such as piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and is thought to also include nets treated with insecticides other than pyrethroid-based formulations. Public health value has been demonstrated for this class and WHO has issued a recommendation for the use of pyrethroid-PBO nets. \u00a0Public health value has not been demonstrated for a first-in-class net treated with non-pyrethroid formulations and no recommendation is in place for such nets. \t ITNs designed to sterilize and\/or reduce the fecundity of host-seeking insecticide-resistant mosquitoes for which a first-in-class product demonstrates public health value compared to the epidemiological impact of pyrethroid-only nets. Public health value of products in this class has yet to be demonstrated. This class is thought to includes nets treated with pyrethroid + pyriproxyfen (an insect growth regulator). This class will be created once the public health value of a first-in-class ITN product containing an insect growth regulator has been demonstrated. No recommendation is in place for such nets.    ITNs are most effective where the principal malaria vector(s) mosquitoes bite predominantly at night after people have retired under their nets. ITNs can be used both indoors and outdoors, wherever they can be suitably hung (although hanging nets in direct sunlight should be avoided, as sunlight can affect insecticidal activity).     Indoor residual spraying   IRS is the application of a residual insecticide to potential malaria vector resting surfaces, such as internal walls, eaves and ceilings of houses or structures (including domestic animal shelters), where such vectors might come into contact with the insecticide. IRS with a product that has been prequalified by WHO PQ is recommended for large-scale deployment in most malaria-endemic locations. DDT, which has not been prequalified, may be used for IRS if no equally effective and efficient alternative is available, and if it is used in line with the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.   IRS is most effective where the vector population is susceptible to the insecticide(s) being applied, the majority of mosquitoes feeds\u00a0and rests\u00a0indoors and where most structures are suitable for spraying.\u00a0"},{"nid":720,"text_data":"4.1.3 - Supplementary interventions     Larval source management (LSM)   LSM in the context of malaria control is the management of water bodies that are potential larval habitats for mosquitoes. Such management of water bodies is conducted to prevent the development of the immature stages (eggs, larvae and pupae) and hence the production of adult mosquitoes, with the overall aim of preventing or controlling transmission of malaria. There are four types of LSM:\u00a0    habitat modification: a permanent alteration to the environment, e.g. land reclamation, filling of water bodies; \t habitat manipulation: a recurrent activity, e.g. flushing of streams, drain clearance; \t larviciding: the regular application of biological or chemical insecticides to water bodies; and \t biological control: the introduction of natural predators into water bodies.      Topical repellents, insecticide-treated clothing and spatial\/airborne repellents   Topical repellents, insecticide-treated clothing and spatial\/airborne repellents have all been proposed as potential methods for preventing malaria in areas where the mosquito vectors bite or rest outdoors, or bite in the early evening or early morning when people are not within housing structures. These methods have also been proposed for specific population groups, such as those who live or work away from permanent housing structures (e.g., migrants, refugees, internally displaced persons, military personnel) or those who work outdoors at night. In these situations, the effectiveness of ITNs or IRS may be reduced. Repellents have also been proposed for use in high-risk groups, such as pregnant mothers. Despite the potential to provide individual protection against bites from malaria vectors, the deployment of the above personal protection methods in large-scale public health campaigns has been limited, at least partially due to the scarcity of evidence of their public health value. Daily compliance and appropriate use of repellents seem to be major obstacles to achieving such potential impact\u00a0   [56]   .\u00a0Individuals\u2019 use of the intervention to achieve personal protection faces the same obstacles.     Space spraying   Space spraying refers to the release of fast-acting insecticides into the air as smoke or as fine droplets as a method to reduce the numbers of adult mosquitoes in dwellings and also outdoors. Application methods include thermal fogging; cold aerosol distribution by handheld or backpack sprayers, ground vehicles or aerial means; and repetitious spraying by two or more sprays in quick succession. Space spraying is most often deployed in response to epidemics or outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease, such as dengue.     Housing modifications   In the context of malaria control, housing modifications are defined as any structural changes, pre- or post-construction, of a house that prevents the entry of mosquitoes and\/or decreases exposure of inhabitants to vectors with the aim of preventing or reducing the transmission of malaria. Housing modifications may encompass a wide range of interventions\u00a0\u2013 from those made at the outset in the structural design of the house and the choice of materials used, to modifications made to existing homes, such as the screening or closure of gaps. In 2018, the WHO Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health published the\u00a0   WHO Housing and health guidelines   \u00a0   [57]   . This document brings together the most recent evidence to provide practical recommendations for reducing the health burden due to unsafe and substandard housing. The review concluded that improved housing conditions have the potential to save lives, prevent disease, increase quality of life, reduce poverty, and help mitigate climate change. It was, however, noted that further evidence was needed on the impact of improved housing in preventing vector-borne diseases. \u00a0 Available evidence indicates that poor-quality housing and neglected peri-domestic environments are risk factors for the transmission of a number of vector-borne diseases such as malaria, arboviral diseases (e.g. dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika virus disease), Chagas disease and leishmaniasis\u00a0   [58]   . Together with metal roofs, ceilings, and finished interior walls, the closing of open eaves, screening doors and windows with fly screens or mosquito netting, and filling holes and cracks in walls and roofs may reduce the mosquitoes\u2019 entry points into houses and potentially reduce transmission of malaria and other vector-borne diseases. A recent review indicated that housing quality is an important risk factor for malaria infection across the spectrum of malaria endemicity in sub-Saharan Africa\u00a0   [59]   \u00a0.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Structural housing interventions that may reduce exposure of inhabitants to mosquitoes fall largely into two categories: \u00a0 1. Primary house construction:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    house designs, such as elevating houses (e.g., using stilts) and using fewer or smaller windows; \t construction materials, such as cement or brick walls, corrugated iron roofing, door designs with fewer openings, and closure of eaves that minimize entry holes for mosquitoes.    2. Modifications to existing house designs:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    non-insecticidal interventions which include screening and covering of potential entry points, filling eaves with mud, sand, rubble or cement,\u00a0\u00a0installing ceilings and conducting wall maintenance to fill in any cracks; \t insecticidal interventions which include insecticidal screening of mosquito entry points, particularly eaves, and the installation of lethal house lures.    Housing modifications are likely to be most effective against mosquitoes that display endophilic and\/or endophagic behaviours (i.e., indoor resting and feeding, respectively).\u00a0"},{"nid":722,"text_data":"4.1.4.1 - Special situations     Residual transmission   WHO acknowledges that even full implementation of ITNs or IRS will not be sufficient to completely halt malaria parasite transmission across all settings\u00a0   [66]   . Some residual malaria parasite transmission will occur, even with optimal access to and usage of ITNs or in areas with high IRS coverage. Residual transmission occurs as a result of a combination of human and vector behaviours, for example, when people reside in or visit forest areas or do not sleep in protected houses, or when local mosquito vector species exhibit one or more behaviours that allow them to avoid ITNs or IRS, such as biting outside early in the evening before people have retired indoors and\/or resting outdoors.   There is an urgent need for greatly improved knowledge of the bionomics of the different sibling species within malaria vector species complexes, and new interventions and strategies in order to effectively address residual transmission. While this knowledge is being gained and interventions are being developed, national malaria control programmes must prioritize the effective implementation of current interventions to reduce transmission to the lowest level possible. At the same time, they should collaborate with academic or research institutions to generate local evidence on the magnitude of the problem of residual transmission of malaria, including information on human and vector behaviours, and the effectiveness of existing and novel interventions.   Residual transmission is difficult to measure, as is the specific impact of supplementary tools on this component of ongoing transmission. Standardized methods for quantifying and characterizing this component of transmission are required in order to evaluate the effectiveness of single or combined interventions in addressing this biological challenge to malaria prevention and control and elimination.     Epidemics and humanitarian emergencies   In the acute phase of a humanitarian emergency, the first priorities for malaria control are prompt and effective diagnosis and treatment. Vector control also has the potential to play an important role in reducing transmission. However, the evidence base on the effectiveness of vector control interventions deployed in these settings is weak\u00a0   [67]   .   During the acute phase, decisions on vector control and prevention will depend on:    Malaria infection risk; \t Behaviour of the human population (e.g. mobility, where they are sleeping or being exposed to vector mosquitoes); \t Behaviour of the local vector population (e.g. indoor resting, indoor biting, early evening or night biting); \t The type of shelter available (e.g. ad-hoc refuse materials, plastic sheeting, tents, more permanent housing).    Effective case management can be supplemented with distribution of ITNs, first targeting population groups most susceptible to developing severe malaria, but with the ultimate goal of achieving and maintaining optimal coverage. IRS can also be applied in well-organized settings, such as transit camps, but is generally unsuitable where dwellings are scattered widely, of a temporary nature (less than three months) or constructed with surfaces that are unsuitable for spraying. IRS is best suited for protecting larger populations in more compact settings, where shelters are more permanent and solid.   Some vector control interventions and personal protection measures have been specifically designed for deployment in acute emergency situations. Plastic sheeting is sometimes provided in the early stages of humanitarian emergencies to enable affected communities to construct temporary shelters. In these new settlements, where shelter is very basic, use of insecticide-treated plastic sheeting (ITPS) to construct shelters may be a practical, acceptable and feasible approach. Laminated polyethylene tarpaulins that are impregnated with a pyrethroid during manufacture are suitable for constructing such shelters. As with IRS, ITPS is only effective against indoor resting mosquitoes, but the degree to which it impacts transmission has yet to be confirmed. Moreover, pyrethroid-treated plastic sheeting should not be deployed in areas where the local malaria vectors are resistant to pyrethroids.   Another intervention with potential for deployment in emergency situations is the long-lasting insecticide impregnated blanket or topsheet. Blankets or lightweight topsheets are often included in emergency relief kits. One advantage of blankets and topsheets is that they can be used anywhere people sleep (e.g. indoors, outdoors, any type of shelter). However, as with ITPS, the evidence base regarding the effectiveness of this approach is currently limited. Data from community RCTs of long-lasting pyrethroid-treated wash-resistant blankets and topsheets would be required to determine public health value and develop specific policy recommendations for such interventions.   In the post-acute phase, optimal coverage with ITNs or IRS may be feasible. Deployment of insecticide-treated plastic sheeting for shelter construction may be more practical in situations where ITN use or the application of IRS is not possible, although currently there is no WHO policy recommendation for this intervention.     Migrant populations and populations engaged in high-risk activities   As noted above, topical repellents and insecticide-treated clothing may be practical interventions for providing personal protection to specific populations at risk of malaria due to occupational exposure, e.g. military personnel, night-shift workers, forestry workers. However, the available evidence does not support the large-scale deployment of such interventions for reducing or preventing infection and\/or disease in humans when assessed at the population level and few studies have reported disease outcomes at the individual level. Data demonstrating epidemiological impact would be required to determine their public health value for these populations."},{"nid":723,"text_data":"4.1.4.2 - Implementation challenges   Vector control plays a vital role in reducing the transmission and burden of vector-borne disease, complementing the public health gains achieved through disease management. Unfortunately, at present, the potential benefits of vector control are far from being fully realized. WHO identifies the following reasons for this shortfall\u00a0   [68]   :    The skills to implement vector control programmes remain scarce, particularly in the resource-poor countries in most need of effective vector-borne disease control. In some cases, this has led to control measures being implemented that are unsuitable, poorly targeted or deployed at insufficient coverage. In turn, this has led to suboptimal resource use and sometimes avoidable insecticide contamination of the environment; \t Insecticide application in agriculture and poor management of insecticides in public health programmes have contributed to resistance in disease vectors; and \t Development programmes, including irrigated agriculture, hydroelectric dam construction, road building, forest clearance, housing development and industrial expansion, all influence vector-borne diseases, yet opportunities for intersectoral collaboration and for adoption of strategies other than those based on insecticides are seldom realized.      Acceptability, participation and ethical considerations   Acceptability and end-user suitability of the vector control interventions included in the Guidelines were considered when developing the Evidence-to-Decision Frameworks, as part of the GRADE process.   ITNs are generally acceptable to most communities. In many malaria-endemic countries, untreated nets were in use for many years prior to the introduction of ITNs and, even where there is not a long history of their use, they have become familiar tools for preventing mosquito bites. Individuals often appreciate the extra privacy afforded by a net, as well as its effectiveness in controlling other nuisance insects. In very hot climates, ITNs may be less acceptable, as they are perceived to reduce air flow, making it too hot to allow for a comfortable sleep. In areas where mosquito densities are low or where malaria transmission is low, individuals and communities may perceive less benefit in using nets.   Community acceptance of IRS is critical to the programme\u2019s success, particularly as it involves disruption to the household, requiring householders to remove certain articles and allow spray teams to enter all rooms of the house. Repeated, frequent spraying of houses over extended periods can lead to refusal by householders. Reduced acceptance has been an impediment to effective IRS implementation in various parts of the world\u00a0   [69]   .   Larviciding for malaria vector control is currently not deployed at the scale of ITNs or IRS, and many communities are therefore unfamiliar with it. Larviciding is likely to be more acceptable in communities that have a good understanding of the lifecycle of mosquitoes and the link with the transmission of malaria or other diseases. Community members may have concerns about larvicides being applied to drinking water or other domestic water sources. A well-designed community sensitization programme is required to ensure that communities fully understand the intervention and that any concerns about health and safety aspects are addressed.   Community participation in the implementation of vector control interventions is often in the form of \u201cinstruction\u201d and \u201cinformation\u201d, with decisions about the need for interventions being made at international and national levels. Taking into account communities\u2019 views on the recommended interventions may promote acceptance and adherence to the intervention. Increased levels of participation (e.g. consultation, inclusion and shared decision-making) should ideally be included in the future development of improved and new vector control interventions, from inception through to the planning and implementation stages.   WHO acknowledges that appropriate policy-making often requires explicit consideration of ethical matters in addition to scientific evidence. However, the ethical issues relevant to vector-borne disease control and research have not previously received the analysis necessary to further improve public health programmes. Moreover, WHO Member States lack specific guidance in this area. The Seventieth World Health Assembly\u00a0   [70]   \u00a0requested the Director-General \u201cto continue to develop and disseminate normative guidance, policy advice and implementation guidance that provides support to Member States to reduce the burden and threat of vector-borne diseases, including to strengthen human-resource capacity and capability for effective, locally adapted, sustainable and ethically sensitive vector control; to review and provide technical guidance on the ethical aspects and issues associated with the implementation of new vector control approaches in order to develop mitigating strategies and solutions; and to undertake a review of the ethical aspects and related issues associated with vector control implementation that include social determinants of health, in order to develop mitigating strategies and solutions to tackle health inequities.\u201d As a first step towards developing appropriate guidelines within the next two years, a scoping meeting was convened by WHO to identify the ethical issues associated with vector-borne diseases\u00a0   [71]   . Further work has been undertaken to develop guidance. Once available, it will be reflected in the Guidelines.   Unique ethical issues associated with vector control that were identified at the February 2017 scoping meeting include the ethics of coercive or mandated vector control, the deployment of insecticides (and growing vector resistance to insecticides), and research on and\/or deployment of new vector control technologies. Genetically modified mosquitoes are one such innovation that presents potential challenges, including how to prevent their spread beyond the intended geographical target areas and limit potential effects on the local fauna. WHO has established a robust evaluation process for new vector control interventions\u00a0   [31]   \u00a0in order to ensure that these are fully and properly assessed prior to any WHO recommendation for their deployment.     Equity, gender and human rights   The aim of all of the work of WHO is to improve population health and decrease health inequities. Sustained improvements to physical, mental and social well-being require actions in which careful attention is paid to equity, human rights principles, gender and other social determinants of health. A heightened focus on equity, human rights, gender and social determinants is expressed in the WHO 13th\u00a0General Programme of Work.   In pursuit of this outcome, WHO is committed to providing guidance on the integration of sustainable approaches that advance health equity, promote and protect human rights, are gender-responsive and address social determinants into WHO programmes and institutional mechanisms; promoting disaggregated data analysis and health inequality monitoring; and providing guidance on the integration of sustainable approaches that advance health equity, promote and protect human rights, are gender-responsive and address social determinants into WHO\u2019s support at country level\u00a0   [72]   .   WHO advocates for optimal coverage with recommended vector control interventions. As such, malaria vector control is expected to be implemented without discrimination on the basis of age, sex, ethnicity, religion or other characteristics. In some cases, special effort is required to reach populations that are geographically isolated or adopt a nomadic lifestyle.   In contrast to the situation observed with HIV and TB, malaria has not been associated with systematic discrimination against individuals or groups assumed to be at a high risk of infection. However, malaria disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations, including the rural poor, pregnant women, children, migrants, refugees, prisoners and indigenous populations. For these populations, social inequality and political marginalization may impede access to health services, and there may be additional barriers created by language, culture, poor sanitation, lack of access to health information, lack of informed consent in testing and treatment, and inability to pay user fees for medical services. National malaria control programmes are increasingly encouraged to identify vulnerable groups and situations of inequitable access to services and to design approaches, strategies and specific activities to remove human rights and gender-related inequities.     Resource implications and prioritization   In this 1st\u00a0edition of the Guidelines, resource implications and the cost-effectiveness of vector control interventions could largely only be addressed through expert opinion. Although it is recognized that such considerations should ideally be based on evidence, sufficient clarity on how to collate and present data for this area of the Guidelines was not available at the time of writing. Expanded evidence-based recommendations on resource implications will be developed and incorporated as part of revision to the Guidelines.   At present, the most recent systematic review of the cost and cost-effectiveness of vector control interventions was published in 2011, drawing on studies published between 1990 and 2010\u00a0   [73]   .\u00a0The body of evidence collated was based on the use of ITNs\/LLINs and IRS in a few sites in sub-Saharan Africa. The authors found large variations in the costs of intervention delivery, which reflected not only the different contexts but also the various types of costing methodologies employed; these studies were rarely undertaken alongside clinical and epidemiological evaluations. The review reported that, while ITNs\/LLINs and IRS were consistently found to be cost-effective across studies, evidence to determine their comparative cost-effectiveness was insufficient. WHO GMP is working with partners to update the evidence review on the cost and cost-effectiveness evidence of the vector control interventions covered in the Guidelines.   Cost-effectiveness analysis \u2013 the comparison of the costs and outcomes of alternative interventions \u2013 can be a helpful tool for measuring the magnitude of additional health gained per additional unit of resources spent. WHO offers a series of tools to facilitate country-level cost-effectiveness analysis, notably through the CHOICE project\u00a0   [74]   . Using the cost-effectiveness ratio in combination with cost-effectiveness thresholds, as applied in the above-mentioned review, provides some indication of the value for money of an intervention. Value for money, however, should not be used as a standalone criterion for decision-making, but rather used alongside other considerations, including affordability and budget impact analysis, among others\u00a0   [75]   . The development of further guidance to inform resource use will be a focus in preparing explicit recommendations on resource use as part of the GRADE tables, using work by other WHO departments as a guide\u00a0   [76]   . Given that resource considerations are highly context-specific and hence unlikely to be detailed enough to inform the prioritization of resources for vector control at country level, further work to guide country-level decision-making is also foreseen, but will be outside the scope of this global guidance document.     Human resources and entomological capacity   The\u00a0   Global vector control response 2017\u20132030   \u00a0   [13]   \u00a0notes that effective and sustainable vector control is achievable only with sufficient human resources, an enabling infrastructure and a functional health system. A vector control needs assessment\u00a0   [15]   \u00a0will help to appraise current capacity, define what is needed to conduct proposed activities, identify opportunities for improved efficiencies in vector control, and guide resource mobilization.   Formulating an inventory of existing human, infrastructural (functioning insectary and entomological laboratory for species identification and resistance testing, vehicles, spray equipment, etc.), institutional and financial resources available, and making an appraisal of existing organizational structures for vector control are essential first steps. The inventory should cover all resources available at national and subnational levels, including districts. A broader appraisal of relevant resources available outside of the vector-borne disease programme, including in municipal governments, non-health ministries, research institutions and implementing partners, should be conducted. An evaluation of career structures within national and subnational programmes is also important. A comprehensive plan for developing the necessary human, infrastructural and institutional capacity within programmes should be formulated. The plan should identify any additional resources and associated costs involved in achieving the desired objectives and set out clear terms of reference for the different staffing positions required.   Capacity-building priorities for established staff should be defined through a comprehensive training needs assessment led by the ministry of health and aligned with available WHO guidance\u00a0   [77]   ."},{"nid":724,"text_data":"4.1.4.3 - Monitoring and evaluation of vector control   Monitoring involves routine data collection and reporting to determine progress made in the implementation of a programme or strategy. Evaluation involves rigorous assessment and attribution of impacts to a programme or strategy. The combination of monitoring and evaluation facilitates understanding of the cause-and-effect relationship between implementation and impact and is used to guide planning and implementation, to assess effectiveness, to identify areas for improvement, and to account for resources used.   Monitoring and evaluation of vector control interventions is covered in detail in the WHO reference manual on malaria surveillance, monitoring and evaluation\u00a0   [20]   . In addition, a brief synopsis of quality assurance is provided below.     Quality assurance of vector control interventions   Quality assurance is the implementation of systematic and well-planned activities to prevent substandard services or products.   Lower than expected effectiveness may be due to a variety of factors related to implementation. These can include incorrect application of the intervention, inadequate procurement planning, poor quality of deployed products and failure to achieve optimal coverage. Quality assurance efforts should be continuous, systematic and independent. Continuous monitoring and supervision are required to ensure that staff are adequately trained and follow technical guidelines for pesticide application and personal safety. Vector control programmes must include a quality assurance programme designed to monitor the effectiveness of the control activities. A quality assurance programme should monitor applicator performance and control outcomes.   The WHO Model Quality Assurance System for Procurement Agencies\u00a0   [78]   \u00a0details the quality assurance steps and processes involved in procuring pharmaceutical products and diagnostics, but the principles are equally applicable to vector control products.   For vector control products, the key elements of quality assurance are:    Sourcing only products prequalified by WHO for deployment against malaria vectors; \t Requesting the supplier\/manufacturer to provide a Certificate of Analysis for each batch of the product actually being supplied; \t Pre-shipment inspection and sampling according to WHO guidance and\/or International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards, performed by an independent sampling agent; \t Pre-shipment testing conducted by an independent quality control laboratory (WHO prequalified, or ISO 17025 or Good Laboratory Practice accredited) to determine that the product conforms to approved specifications according to the WHO\/CIPAC test methods; \t Testing on receipt in country (post-shipment quality control testing) should only be conducted if specific risks related to transport have been identified or specific concerns over potential product performance justify this additional expense; \t Tender conditions should include provisions for free-of-cost replacement of shipments that fail quality control checks and disposal of failed lots; \t Post-marketing surveillance may be required, depending on the product and context, to monitor performance over time in order to ensure that products continue to conform to their specifications and\/or recommended performance as set by WHO. For ITNs, this may require testing both physical durability and insecticidal efficacy. For IRS products, bioefficacy on sprayed surfaces of a different nature (e.g. mud, brick), as applicable, should be periodically tested according to WHO procedures when an insecticide is first introduced into a country. Subsequent measurement of insecticide decay on sprayed surfaces should be done only if necessary, as it will incur additional expense. Countries can make post-marketing surveillance a priority in cases where there are no country-specific data on certain ITNs or IRS products, or where anecdotal data on poor performance of certain products may exist. Agreement on the need and scope of the proposed activities should be reached by all in-country stakeholders, including the national regulatory authority. All evaluations should follow WHO guidance.      Quality assurance of the field application of vector control interventions should form an integral part of the national programme\u2019s strategy and should include:    High-quality training for all staff engaged in field implementation of vector control interventions; \t Regular supervision, monitoring and follow-up of field operations; \t Periodic testing of the quality of IRS operations through WHO cone bioassay of sprayed surfaces; \t Periodic testing of the insecticide concentration on ITNs using WHO cone bioassay and\/or chemical analysis.      The WHO cone bioassay (preferably using fully susceptible anophelines obtained from insectaries) is currently the only tool available for assessing the bioefficacy of ITNs and the quality of the application of IRS insecticides to walls and other internal surfaces. Colorimetric assays are under development that aim to rapidly quantify the amount of insecticide on a sprayed surface in the field without the need for a bioassay on live mosquitoes. These colorimetric assays, when available, should enable programmes to increase the speed and ease of quality assurance testing of IRS applications."},{"nid":725,"text_data":"4.1.5 - Research needs   WHO\u2019s guideline development process for new vector control interventions relies on evidence from at least two well-designed and well-conducted studies with epidemiological endpoints to demonstrate the public health value of the intervention. If the initial two studies generate contradictory or inconsistent results or suffer from design limitations that preclude comprehensive assessment of an intervention\u2019s potential public health value, further trials with epidemiological endpoints may be required. As such, WHO encourages the use of appropriate study designs, including the generation of baseline data and appropriate follow-up times that consider the characteristics of the intervention and its intended deployment, expected durability\/residual efficacy and replacement intervals, and the epidemiology (e.g., pathogen transmission intensity) of the selected study site. WHO encourages studies to be conducted for durations that maximize the likelihood that the study objectives and targeted statistical power will be robustly achieved so as to strengthen the evidence used to inform deliberations by a GDG regarding a potential WHO recommendation. \u00a0Detailed descriptions of the setting, interventions deployed, and vector species targeted are required. Investigators are encouraged to share their study design and methodology with WHO prior to commencing the study in order to enable the VCAG to validate whether the data generated are likely to provide quality evidence to inform the development of a WHO recommendation. High research standards should be employed in conducting, analysing and reporting studies, ensuring that studies are adequately powered, and appropriate randomization methods and statistical analyses are used. WHO requires studies to be conducted in compliance with international ethical standards and good clinical and laboratory practices. Further information on evaluation standard for vector control interventions can be found in\u00a0   Norms, standards and processes underpinning WHO vector control policy development   \u00a0   [31]   .  * Harms\/unintended consequences may include undesirable effects on individuals, the community, mosquito bionomics and the environment.\u00a0   Other research needs and evidence gaps required to further update guidance were identified as follows:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    evidence on the linkage or correlation between the epidemiological and entomological endpoints used to demonstrate impact; \t evidence on contextual factors (i.e., structural challenges and opportunities, acceptability, feasibility, resource use, cost-effectiveness, equity, values and preferences in various settings) related to different vector control interventions; \t evidence to support the resources listed and other considerations for resource use provided under each recommended intervention in order to aid guidance on prioritization of interventions (wherever possible, following examples provided in other WHO guidance and guidelines); and \t evidence of the benefits (incidence of clinical malaria and\/or or prevalence of malaria infection) as well as harms\/unintended consequences of deployment of interventions in special situations. For example, a) interventions designed to control outdoor transmission of malaria, and b) protecting specific populations with high occupational exposure to malaria"},{"nid":730,"text_data":"5.2.2 - Duration of treatment   A 3-day course of the artemisinin component of ACTs covers two asexual cycles, ensuring that only a small fraction of parasites remain for clearance by the partner drug, thus reducing the potential development of resistance to the partner drug. Shorter courses (1\u20132 days) are therefore not recommended, as they are less effective, have less effect on gametocytes and provide less protection for the slowly eliminated partner drug."},{"nid":731,"text_data":"5.2.3 - Dosing of ACTS   ACT regimens must ensure optimal dosing to prolong their useful therapeutic life, i.e. to maximize the likelihood of rapid clinical and parasitological cure, minimize transmission and retard drug resistance.   It is essential to achieve effective antimalarial drug concentrations for a sufficient time (exposure) in all target populations in order to ensure high cure rates.\u00a0The dosage recommendations below are derived from understanding the relationship between dose and the profiles of exposure to the drug (pharmacokinetics) and the resulting therapeutic efficacy (pharmacodynamics) and safety. Some patient groups, notably younger children, are not dosed optimally with the \u201cdosage regimens recommended by manufacturers, which compromises efficacy and fuels resistance. In these guidelines when there was pharmacological evidence that certain patient groups are not receiving optimal doses, dose regimens were adjusted to ensure similar exposure across all patient groups.   Weight-based dosage recommendations are summarized below. While age-based dosing may be more practical in children, the relation between age and weight differs in different populations. Age-based dosing can therefore result in under- dosing or over-dosing of some patients, unless large, region-specific weight-for-age databases are available to guide dosing in that region.   Factors other than dosage regimen may also affect exposure to a drug and thus treatment efficacy. The drug exposure of an individual patient also depends on factors such as the quality of the drug, the formulation, adherence and, for some drugs, co-administration with fat. Poor adherence is a major cause of treatment failure and drives the emergence and spread of drug resistance. Fixed-dose combinations encourage adherence and are preferred to loose (individual) tablets. Prescribers should take the time necessary to explain to patients why they should complete antimalarial course. \u00a0   Artemether + lumefantrine   Formulations currently available: Dispersible or standard tablets containing 20 mg artemether and 120 mg lumefantrine, and standard tablets containing 40 mg artemether and 240 mg lumefantrine in a fixed-dose combination formulation. The flavoured dispersible tablet paediatric formulation facilitates use in young children.   Target dose range: A total dose of 5\u201324 mg\/kg bw of artemether and 29\u2013144 mg\/ kg bw of lumefantrine   Recommended dosage regimen: Artemether + lumefantrine is given twice a day for 3 days (total, six doses). The first two doses should, ideally, be given 8 h apart.  Factors associated with altered drug exposure and treatment response:    Decreased exposure to lumefantrine has been documented in young children (&lt;3 years) as well as pregnant women, large adults, patients taking mefloquine, rifampicin or efavirenz and in smokers. As these target populations may be at increased risk for treatment failure, their responses to treatment should be monitored more closely and their full adherence ensured. \t Increased exposure to lumefantrine has been observed in patients concomitantly taking lopinavir- lopinavir\/ritonavir-based antiretroviral agents but with no increase in toxicity; therefore, no dosage adjustment is indicated.    Additional comments:    An advantage of this ACT is that lumefantrine is not available as a monotherapy and has never been used alone for the treatment of malaria. \t Absorption of lumefantrine is enhanced by co-administration with fat. Patients or caregivers should be informed that this ACT should be taken immediately after food or a fat containing drink (e.g. milk), particularly on the second and third days of treatment.      Artesunate + amodiaquine   Formulations currently available: A fixed-dose combination in tablets containing 25 + 67.5 mg, 50 + 135 mg or 100 + 270 mg of artesunate and amodiaquine, respectively   Target\u00a0 dose and range: The target dose (and range) are 4 (2\u201310) mg\/kg bw per day artesunate and 10 (7.5\u201315) mg\/kg bw per day amodiaquine once a day for 3 days. A total therapeutic dose range of 6\u201330 mg\/kg bw per day artesunate and 22.5\u201345 mg\/kg bw per dose amodiaquine is recommended.  Factors associated with altered drug exposure and treatment response:    \t Treatment failure after amodiaquine monotherapy was more frequent among children who were underweight for their age. Therefore, their response to artesunate + amodiaquine treatment should be closely monitored. \t \t \t Artesunate + amodiaquine is associated with severe neutropenia, particularly in patients co-infected with HIV and especially in those on zidovudine and\/or cotrimoxazole. Concomitant use of efavirenz increases exposure to amodiaquine and hepatotoxicity. Thus, concomitant use of artesunate + amodiaquine by patients taking zidovudine, efavirenz and cotrimoxazole should be avoided, unless this is the only ACT promptly available. \t    Additional comments:    \t No significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of amodiaquine or its metabolite desethylamodiaquine have been observed during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy; therefore, no dosage adjustments are recommended. \t \t \t No effect of age has been observed on the plasma concentrations of amodiaquine and desethylamodiaquine, so no dose adjustment by age is indicated. Few data are available on the pharmacokinetics of amodiaquine in the first year of life. \t      Artesunate + mefloquine   Formulations currently available: A fixed-dose formulation of paediatric tablets containing 25 mg artesunate and 55 mg mefloquine hydrochloride (equivalent to 50 mg mefloquine base) and adult tablets containing 100 mg artesunate and 220 mg mefloquine hydrochloride (equivalent to 200 mg mefloquine base)   Target dose and range: Target doses (ranges) of 4 (2\u201310) mg\/kg bw per day artesunate and 8.3 (7\u201311) mg\/kg bw per day mefloquine, given once a day for 3 days  Additional comments:    \t Mefloquine was associated with increased incidences of nausea, vomiting, dizziness, dysphoria and sleep disturbance in clinical trials, but these symptoms are seldom debilitating, and, where this ACT has been used, it has generally been well tolerated. To reduce acute vomiting and optimize absorption, the total mefloquine dose should preferably be split over 3 days, as in current fixed-dose combinations. \t \t \t As concomitant use of rifampicin decreases exposure to mefloquine, potentially decreasing its efficacy, patients taking this drug should be followed up carefully to identify treatment failures. \t      Artesunate + sulfadoxine\u2013pyrimethamine   Formulations: Currently available as blister-packed, scored tablets containing 50 mg artesunate and fixed dose combination tablets comprising 500 mg sulfadoxine + 25 mg pyrimethamine. There is no fixed-dose combination.   Target dose and range: A target dose (range) of 4 (2\u201310) mg\/kg bw per day artesunate given once a day for 3 days and a single administration of at least 25 \/ 1.25 (25\u201370 \/ 1.25\u20133.5) mg\/kg bw sulfadoxine \/ pyrimethamine given as a single dose on day 1.  Factors associated with altered drug exposure and treatment response: The low dose of folic acid (0.4 mg daily) that is required to protect the fetuses of pregnant women from neural tube defects do not reduce the efficacy of SP, whereas higher doses (5 mg daily) do significantly reduce its efficacy \u00a0and should not be given concomitantly.   Additional comments:    \t The disadvantage of this ACT is that it is not available as a fixed-dose combination. This may compromise adherence and increase the risk for distribution of loose artesunate tablets, despite the WHO ban on artesunate monotherapy. \t \t \t Resistance is likely to increase with continued widespread use of SP, sulfalene\u2013 pyrimethamine and cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). Fortunately, molecular markers of resistance to antifols and sulfonamides correlate well with therapeutic responses. These should be monitored in areas in which this drug is used. \t    \u00a0"},{"nid":732,"text_data":"5.2.4 - Recurrent falciparum malaria   Recurrence of\u00a0 P.   \u00a0falciparum\u00a0 malaria can result from re-infection or recrudescence (treatment failure). Treatment failure may result from drug resistance or inadequate exposure to the drug due to sub-optimal dosing, poor adherence, vomiting, unusual pharmacokinetics in an individual, or substandard medicines. It is important to determine from the patient\u2019s history whether he or she vomited the previous treatment or did not complete a full course of treatment.   When possible, treatment failure must be confirmed parasitologically. This may require referring the patient to a facility with microscopy or LDH-based RDTs, \u00a0as\u00a0 P. falciparum\u00a0 histidine-rich protein-2 ( Pf HRP2)-based tests may remain positive for weeks after the initial infection, even without recrudescence. Referral may be necessary anyway to obtain second-line treatment. In individual patients, it may not be possible to distinguish recrudescence from re-infection, although lack of resolution of fever and parasitaemia or their recurrence within 4 weeks of treatment are considered failures of treatment with currently recommended ACTs. In many cases, treatment failures are missed because patients are not asked whether they received antimalarial treatment within the preceding 1\u20132 months. Patients who present with malaria should be asked this question routinely.    Failure within 28 days   The recommended second-line treatment is an alternative ACT known to be effective in the region. Adherence to 7-day treatment regimens (with artesunate or quinine both of which should be co-administered with + tetracycline, or doxycycline or clindamycin) is likely to be poor if treatment is not directly observed; these regimens are no longer generally recommended. The distribution and use of oral artesunate monotherapy outside special centres are\u00a0strongly discouraged, and quinine-containing regimens are not well tolerated.     Failure after 28 days   Recurrence of fever and parasitaemia &gt; 4 weeks after treatment may be due to either recrudescence or a new infection. The distinction can be made only by PCR genotyping of parasites from the initial and the recurrent infections.   As PCR is not routinely used in patient management, all presumed treatment failures after 4 weeks of initial treatment should, from an operational standpoint, be considered new infections and be treated with the first-line ACT. However, reuse of mefloquine within 60 days of first treatment is associated with an increased risk for neuropsychiatric reactions, and an alternative ACT should be used."},{"nid":734,"text_data":"5.3.1 - Pregnant and lactating women  Malaria in pregnancy is associated with low-birth-weight infants, increased anaemia and, in low-transmission areas, increased risks for severe malaria, pregnancy loss and death. In high-transmission settings, despite the adverse effects on fetal growth, malaria is usually asymptomatic in pregnancy or is associated with only mild, non-specific symptoms. There is insufficient information on the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of most antimalarial agents in pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester.     First trimester of pregnancy   See Justification under recommendation.     Second and third trimesters    Experience with artemisinin derivatives in the second and third trimesters (over 4000 documented pregnancies) is increasingly reassuring: no adverse effects on the mother or fetus have been reported. The current assessment of risk\u2013benefit suggests that ACTs should be used to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.The current standard six-dose artemether + lumefantrine regimen for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria has been evaluated in &gt; 1000 women in the second and third trimesters in controlled trials and has been found to be well tolerated and safe. In a low-transmission setting on the Myanmar\u2013Thailand border,however,the efficacy of the standard six-dose artemether + lumefantrine regimen was inferior to 7 days of artesunate monotherapy. The lower efficacy may have been due to lower drug concentrations in pregnancy, as was also recently observed in a high-transmission area in Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania. Although many women in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy in Africa have been exposed to artemether + lumefantrine, further studies are under way to evaluate its efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety in pregnant women. Similarly, many pregnant women in Africa have been treated with amodiaquine alone or combined with SP or artesunate; however,amodiaquine use for the treatment of malaria in pregnancy has been formally documented in only &gt; 1300 pregnancies. Use of amodiaquine in women in Ghana in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy was associated with frequent minor side- effects but not with liver toxicity,bone marrow depression or adverse neonatal outcomes. \u00a0  Dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine was used successfully in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy in &gt; 2000 women on the Myanmar\u2013Thailand border for rescue therapy and in Indonesia for first-line treatment. SP, although considered safe, is not appropriate for use as an artesunate partner drug in many areas because of resistance to SP. If artesunate + SP is used for treatment, co-administration of daily high doses (5 mg) of folate supplementation should be avoided, as this compromises the efficacy of SP. A lower dose of folate (0.4\u20130.5 mg bw\/day) or a treatment other than artesunate + SP should be used.   Mefloquine is considered safe for the treatment of malaria during the second and third trimesters; however,it should be given only in combination with an artemisinin derivative.   Quinine is associated with an increased risk for hypoglycaemia in late pregnancy,and it should be used (with clindamycin) only if effective alternatives are not available.   Primaquine and tetracyclines should not be used in pregnancy.     Dosing in pregnancy   Data on the pharmacokinetics of antimalarial agents used during pregnancy are limited. Those available indicate that pharmacokinetic properties are often altered during pregnancy but that the alterations are insufficient\u00a0 to\u00a0 warrant\u00a0 dose\u00a0 modifications\u00a0 at this time. With quinine, no significant differences in exposure have been seen during pregnancy. Studies of the pharmacokinetics of SP used in IPTp in many sites show significantly decreased exposure to sulfadoxine, but the findings on exposure to pyrimethamine are inconsistent.Therefore,no dose modification is warranted at this time.   Studies are available of the pharmacokinetics of artemether + lumefantrine, artesunate + mefloquine and dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine. Most data exist for artemether + lumefantrine; these suggest decreased overall exposure during the second and third trimesters. Simulations suggest that a standard six-dose regimen of lumefantrine given over 5 days, rather than 3 days, improves exposure, but the data are insufficient to recommend this alternative regimen at present.Limited data on pregnant women treated with dihydroartemesinin + piperaquine suggest lower dihydroartemisinin exposure and no overall difference in total piperaquine exposure, but a shortened piperaquine elimination half-life was noted.The data on artesunate + mefloquine are insufficient to recommend an adjustment of dosage. No data are available on the pharmacokinetics of artesunate + amodiaquine in pregnant women with falciparum malaria, although drug exposure was similar in pregnant and non-pregnant women with vivax malaria.     Lactating women   The amounts of antimalarial drugs that enter breast milk and are consumed by breastfeeding infants are relatively small. Tetracycline is contraindicated in breastfeeding mothers because of its potential effect on infants\u2019 bones and teeth. Pending further information on excretion in breast milk, primaquine should not be used for nursing women, unless the breastfed infant has been checked for G6PD deficiency."},{"nid":735,"text_data":"5.3.2 - Young children and infants  Artemisinin derivatives are safe and well tolerated by young children; therefore, the choice of ACT is determined largely by the safety and tolerability of the partner drug.   SP (with artesunate) should be avoided in the first weeks of life because it displaces bilirubin competitively and could thus aggravate neonatal hyperbilibinaemia. Primaquine should be avoided in the first 6 months of life (although there are no data on its toxicity in infants), and tetracyclines should be avoided throughout infancy. With these exceptions, none of the other currently recommended antimalarial treatments has shown serious toxicity in infancy.   Delay in treating\u00a0 P. falciparum\u00a0 malaria in infants and young children can have fatal consequences, particularly for more severe infections. The uncertainties noted above should not delay treatment with the most effective drugs available. In treating young children, it is important to ensure accurate dosing and retention of the administered dose, as infants are more likely to vomit or regurgitate antimalarial treatment than older children or adults. Taste, volume, consistency and gastrointestinal tolerability are important determinants of whether the child retains the treatment. Mothers often need advice on techniques of drug administration and the importance of administering the drug again if it is regurgitated within 1 h of administration. Because deterioration in infants can be rapid, the threshold for use of parenteral treatment should be much lower.     Optimal antimalarial dosing in young children   Although dosing on the basis of body area is recommended for many drugs in young children, for the sake of simplicity, antimalarial drugs have been administered as a standard dose per kg bw for all patients, including young children and infants. This approach does not take into account changes in drug disposition that occur with development. The currently recommended doses of lumefantrine, piperaquine, SP, artesunate and chloroquine result in lower drug concentrations in young children and infants than in older patients. Adjustments to previous dosing regimens for dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine in uncomplicated malaria and for artesunate in severe malaria are now recommended to improve the drug exposure in this vulnerable population. The available evidence for artemether + lumefantrine, SP and chloroquine does not indicate dose modification at this time, but young children should be closely monitored, as reduced drug exposure may increase the risk for treatment failure. Limited studies of amodiaquine and mefloquine showed no significant effect of age on plasma concentration profiles.   In community situations where parenteral treatment is needed but cannot be given, such as for infants and young children who vomit antimalarial drugs repeatedly or are too weak to swallow or are very ill, give rectal artesunate and transfer the patient to a facility in which parenteral treatment is possible. Rectal administration of a single dose of artesunate as pre-referral treatment reduces the risks for death and neurological disability, as long as this initial treatment\u00a0 \u00a0is followed by appropriate parenteral antimalarial treatment in hospital. Further evidence on pre-referral rectal administration of artesunate and other antimalarial drugs is given in  section 5.5.3  Treating severe malaria - pre-referral treatment options. \u00a0   Optimal antimalarial dosing in infants   See recommendation for Infants less than 5kg body weight below.     Optimal antimalarial dosing in malnourished young children   Malaria and malnutrition frequently coexist. Malnutrition may result in inaccurate dosing when doses are based on age (a dose may be too high for an infant with a low weight for age) or on weight (a dose may be too low for an infant with\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a low weight for age). Although many studies of the efficacy of antimalarial drugs have been conducted in populations and settings where malnutrition was prevalent, there are few studies of the disposition of the drugs specifically in malnourished individuals, and these seldom distinguished between acute and chronic malnutrition. Oral absorption of drugs may be reduced if there is diarrhoea or vomiting, or rapid gut transit or atrophy of the small bowel mucosa. Absorption of intramuscular and possibly intrarectal drugs may be slower, and diminished muscle mass may make it difficult to administer repeated intramuscular injections to malnourished patients. The volume of distribution of some drugs may be larger and the plasma concentrations lower. Hypoalbuminaemia may reduce protein binding and increase metabolic clearance, but concomitant hepatic dysfunction may reduce the metabolism of some drugs; the net result is uncertain.   Small studies of the pharmacokinetics of quinine and chloroquine showed alterations in people with different degrees of malnutrition. Studies of SP in IPTp and of amodiaquine monotherapy and dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine for treatment suggest reduced efficacy in malnourished children. A pooled analysis of data for individual patients showed that the concentrations of lumefantrine on day 7 were lower in children &lt; 3 years who were underweight for age than in adequately nourished children and adults. Although these findings are concerning, they are insufficient to warrant dose modifications (in mg\/kg bw) of any antimalarial drug in patients with malnutrition."},{"nid":736,"text_data":"5.3.3 - Patients co-infected with HIV  There is considerable geographical overlap between malaria and HIV infection, and many people are co-infected. Worsening HIV-related immunosuppression may lead to more severe manifestations of malaria. In HIV-infected pregnant women, the adverse effects of placental malaria on birth weight are increased. In areas of stable endemic malaria, HIV-infected patients who are partially immune to malaria may have more frequent, higher-density infections, while in areas of unstable transmission, HIV infection is associated with increased risks for severe malaria and malaria-related deaths. Limited information is available on how HIV infection modifies therapeutic responses to ACTs. Early studies suggested that increasing HIV-related immunosuppression was associated with decreased treatment response to antimalarial drugs. There is presently insufficient information to modify the general malaria treatment recommendations for patients with HIV\/AIDS. \u00a0    Patients co-infected with tuberculosis   Rifamycins, in particular rifampicin, are potent CYP3A4 inducers with weak antimalarial activity. Concomitant administration of rifampicin during quinine treatment of adults with malaria was associated with a significant decrease in exposure to quinine and a five-fold higher recrudescence rate. Similarly, concomitant rifampicin with mefloquine in healthy adults was associated with a three-fold decrease in exposure to mefloquine. In adults co-infected with HIV and tuberculosis who were being treated with rifampicin, administration of artemether + lumefantrine resulted in significantly lower exposure to artemether, dihydroartemisinin and lumefantrine (nine-, six- and three-fold decreases, respectively).There is insufficient evidence at this time to change the current mg\/kg bw dosing recommendations; however, as these patients are at higher risk of recrudescent infections they should be monitored closely."},{"nid":737,"text_data":"5.3.4 - Non-immune travellers  Travellers who acquire malaria are often non-immune people living in cities in endemic countries with little or no transmission or are visitors from non-endemic countries travelling to areas with malaria transmission. Both are at higher risk for severe malaria. In a malaria-endemic country, they should be treated according to national policy, provided the treatment recommended has a recent proven cure rate &gt; 90%. Travellers who return to a non-endemic country and then develop malaria present a particular problem, and the case fatality rate is often high; doctors in non-malarious areas may be unfamiliar with malaria and the diagnosis is commonly delayed, and effective antimalarial drugs may not be registered or may be unavailable. However prevention of transmission or the emergence of resistance are not relevant outside malaria-endemic areas. If the patient has taken chemoprophylaxis, the same medicine should not be used for treatment. Treatment of\u00a0 P. vivax ,\u00a0 P. ovale\u00a0 and\u00a0 P. malariae\u00a0 malaria in travellers should be the same as for patients in endemic areas (see  section 5.4 ).   There may be delays in obtaining artesunate, artemether or quinine for the management of severe malaria outside endemic areas. If only parenteral quinidine is available, it should be given, with careful clinical and electrocardiographic monitoring (see  section 5.5  Treating severe malaria)."},{"nid":738,"text_data":"5.3.5 - Uncomplicated hyperparasitaemia  Uncomplicated hyperparasitaemia is present in patients who have \u2265 4% parasitaemia but no signs of severity. They are at increased risk for severe malaria and for treatment failure and\u00a0are considered an important source of antimalarial drug resistance."},{"nid":741,"text_data":"5.5.3 - Pre-referral treatment options   The risk for death from severe malaria is greatest in the first 24 h, yet, in most malaria-endemic countries, the transit time between referral and arrival at a health facility where intravenous treatment can be administered is usually long, thus delaying the start of appropriate antimalarial treatment. During this time, the patient may deteriorate or die. It is therefore recommended that patients, particularly young children, be treated with a first dose of one of the recommended treatments before referral (unless the referral time is &lt;6 h).   The recommended pre-referral treatment options for children &lt;6 years, in descending order of preference, are intramuscular artesunate; rectal artesunate; intramuscular artemether; and intramuscular quinine. For older children and adults, the recommended pre-referral treatment options, in descending order of preference, are intramuscular injections of artesunate; artemether; and quinine.   Administration of an artemisinin derivative by the rectal route as pre-referral treatment is feasible and acceptable even at community level. The only trial of rectal artesunate as pre-referral treatment showed the expected reduction in mortality of young children but unexpectedly found increased mortality in older children and adults. As a consequence, rectal artesunate is recommended for use only in children aged &lt;6 years and only when intramuscular artesunate is not available.   When rectal artesunate is used, patients should be transported immediately to a higher-level facility where intramuscular or intravenous treatment is available. If referral is impossible, rectal treatment could be continued until the patient can tolerate oral medication. At this point, a full course of the recommended ACT for uncomplicated malaria should be administered.   The single dose of 10 mg\/kg bw of artesunate when given as a suppository should be administered rectally as soon as a presumptive diagnosis of severe malaria is made. If the suppository is expelled from the rectum within 30 min of insertion, a second suppository should be inserted and the buttocks held together for 10 min to ensure retention of the dose."},{"nid":742,"text_data":"5.7.1 - Management of malaria cases in special situations    Epidemics and humanitarian emergencies   Environmental, political and economic changes, population movement and war can all contribute to the emergence or re-emergence of malaria in areas where it was previously eliminated or well controlled. The displacement of large numbers of people with little or no immunity within malaria-endemic areas increases the risk for malaria epidemics among the displaced population, while displacement of people from an endemic area to an area where malaria has been eliminated can result in re-introduction of transmission and a risk for epidemics in the resident population.   Climate change may also alter transmission patterns and the malaria burden globally by producing conditions that favour vector breeding and there by increasing the risks for malaria transmission and epidemics.     Parasitological diagnosis during epidemics   In the acute phase of epidemics and complex emergency situations, facilities\u00a0 for laboratory diagnosis with good-quality equipment and reagents and skilled technicians are often not available or are overwhelmed. Attempts should be made to improve diagnostic capacity rapidly, including provision of RDTs. If diagnostic testing is not feasible, the most practical approach is to treat all febrile patients as suspected malaria cases, with the inevitable consequences of over-treatment of malaria and potentially poor management of other febrile conditions. If this approach is used, it is imperative to monitor intermittently the prevalence of malaria as a true cause of fever and revise the policy appropriately. This approach has sometimes been termed \u201cmass fever treatment\u201d. This is not the same as and should not be confused with \u201cmass drug administration\u201d, which is administration of a complete treatment course of antimalarial medicines to every individual in a geographically defined area without testing for infection and regardless of the presence of symptoms.     Management of uncomplicated falciparum malaria during epidemics   The principles of treatment of uncomplicated malaria are the same as those outlined in  section 5.2 . Active case detection should be undertaken to ensure that as many patients as possible receive adequate treatment, rather than relying on patients to come to a clinic.     Epidemics of mixed falciparum and vivax or vivax malaria    ACTs (except artesunate + SP) should be used to treat uncomplicated malaria in mixed-infection epidemics, as they are highly effective against all malaria species. In areas with pure\u00a0 P. vivax\u00a0 epidemics, ACTs or chloroquine (if prevalent strains are sensitive) should be used.     Anti-relapse therapy for\u00a0 P. vivax \u00a0malaria   Administration of 14-day primaquine anti-relapse therapy for vivax malaria may be impractical in epidemic situations because of the duration of treatment and the difficulty of ensuring adherence. If adequate records are kept, therapy can be given in the post-epidemic period to patients who have been treated with blood schizontocides.     Malaria elimination settings   Use of gametocytocidal drugs to reduce transmission   ACT reduces\u00a0 P. falciparum\u00a0 gametocyte carriage and transmission markedly, but this effect is incomplete, and patients presenting with gametocytaemia may be infectious for days or occasionally weeks, despite\u00a0 ACT. The\u00a0 strategy of\u00a0 using\u00a0 a\u00a0 single\u00a0 dose of primaquine to reduce infectivity and thus\u00a0 P. falciparum\u00a0 transmission has been widely used in low transmission settings.   Use of primaquine as a\u00a0 P. falciparum\u00a0 gametocytocide has a particular role in programmes to eliminate\u00a0 P. falciparum\u00a0 malaria.The population benefits of reducing malaria transmission by\u00a0 gametocytocidal\u00a0\u00a0 drugs\u00a0 require\u00a0 that\u00a0a\u00a0high\u00a0 proportion of patients\u00a0 receive\u00a0these\u00a0medicines. WHO recommends the addition of a single dose\u00a0of\u00a0primaquine\u00a0 (0.25 mg base\/kg bw) to ACT for uncomplicated falciparum malaria as a gametocytocidal medicine, particularly as a component of pre-elimination or elimination programmes. A recent review of the evidence on the safety and effectiveness of primaquine as a gametocytocide of\u00a0 P. falciparum\u00a0 indicates that a single dose of 0.25 mg base\/kg bw is effective in blocking infectivity to mosquitos and is unlikely to cause serious toxicity in people with any of the G6PD variants.Thus, the G6PD status of the patient does not have to be known before primaquine is used for this indication.     Artemisinin-resistant falciparum malaria   Artemisinin resistance in\u00a0 P. falciparum\u00a0 is now prevalent in parts of Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam. There is currently no evidence for artemisinin resistance outside these areas. The particular advantage of artemisinins over other antimalarial drugs is that they kill circulating ring-stage parasites and thus accelerate therapeutic responses.This is lost in resistance to artemisinin.As a consequence, parasite clearance is slowed, and ACT failure rates and gametocytaemia both increase.The reduced efficacy of artemisinin places greater selective pressure on the partner drugs,to which resistance is also increasing.This situation poses a grave threat. In the past chloroquine resistant parasites emerged near the Cambodia\u2013Thailand border and then spread throughout Asia and Africa at a cost of millions of lives. In Cambodia, where artemisinin resistance is worst, none of the currently recommended treatment regimens provides acceptable cure rates (&gt; 90%), and continued use of ineffective drug regimens fuels the spread of resistance. In Cambodia use of atovaquone\u2013proguanil instead of ACT resulted in very rapid emergence of resistance to atovaquone.   In this dangerous,rapidly changing situation,local treatment guidelines cannot be based on a solid evidence base; however,the risks associated with continued use of ineffective regimens are likely to exceed the risks of new, untried regimens with generally safe antimalarial drugs. At the current levels of resistance, the artemisinin derivatives still provide significant antimalarial activity; therefore, longer courses of treatment with existing or new augmented combinations or treatment with new partner medicines (e.g. artesunate + pyronaridine) may be effective. Studies to determine the best treatments for artemisinin-resistant malaria are needed urgently.   It is strongly recommended that single-dose primaquine (as a gametocytocide) be added to all falciparum malaria treatment regimens as described in  section 5.2.5 . For the treatment of severe malaria in areas with established artemisinin resistance, it is recommended that parenteral artesunate and parenteral quinine be given\u00a0together\u00a0in full doses, as described in  section 5.5 ."},{"nid":743,"text_data":"5.7.2 - Quality of antimalarial drugs  The two general classes of poor-quality medicines are those that are\u00a0 falsified\u00a0 (counterfeit), in which there is criminal intent to deceive and the drug contains little or no active ingredient (and often other potentially harmful substances), and those that are\u00a0 substandard , in which a legitimate producer has included incorrect amounts of active drug and\/or excipients in the medicine, or the medicine has been stored incorrectly or for too long and has degraded. Falsified antimalarial tablets and ampoules containing little or no active pharmaceutical ingredients are a major problem in some areas. They may be impossible to distinguish at points of care from the genuine product and may lead to under-dosage and high levels of treatment failure, giving a mistaken impression of resistance, or encourage the development of resistance by providing sub-therapeutic blood levels. They may also contain toxic ingredients.   Substandard drugs result from poor-quality manufacture and formulation, chemical instability or improper or prolonged storage. Artemisinin and its derivatives in particular have built-in chemical instability, which is necessary for their biological action but which causes pharmaceutical problems both in their manufacture and in their co-formulation with other compounds. The problems of instability are accelerated under tropical conditions. The requirement for stringent quality standards is particularly important for this class of compounds. Many antimalarial drugs are stored in conditions of high heat and humidity and sold beyond their expiry dates.   In many malaria-endemic areas, a large proportion of the antimalarial drugs used are generic products purchased in the private sector. They may contain the correct amounts of antimalarial drug, but, because of their formulation, are inadequately absorbed. Antimalarial medicines must be manufactured according to good manufacturing practice, have the correct drug and excipient contents, be proved to have bioavailability that is similar to that of the reference product, have been stored under appropriate conditions and be dispensed before their expiry date.   Tools to assess drug quality at points of sale are being developed, but the capacity of medicines regulatory agencies in most countries to monitor drug quality is still limited. Legal and regulatory frameworks must be strengthened, and there should be greater collaboration between law enforcement agencies, customs and excise authorities and medicines regulatory agencies to deal more effectively with falsified medicines. Private sector drug distribution outlets should have more information and active engagement with regulatory agencies. WHO, in collaboration with other United Nations agencies, has established an international mechanism to prequalify manufacturers of ACTs on the basis of their compliance with internationally recommended standards of manufacture and quality. Manufacturers of antimalarial medicines with prequalified status are listed on the prequalification web site\u00a0   [149]   ."},{"nid":744,"text_data":"5.7.3 - Monitoring efficacy and safety of antimalarial drugs and resistance   When adapting and implementing these guidelines, countries should also strengthen their systems for monitoring and evaluating their national programmes. The systems should allow countries to track the implementation and impact of new recommendations, better target their programmes to the areas and populations at greatest need and detect decreasing antimalarial efficacy and drug resistance as early as possible.     Routine surveillance   WHO promotes universal coverage with diagnostic testing and antimalarial treatment and strengthened malaria surveillance systems. In the \u201ctest, track, treat\u201d initiative, it is recommended that every\u00a0 suspected\u00a0 malaria case is tested, that every\u00a0 confirmed\u00a0 case is treated with a quality-assured antimalarial medicine and that the disease is tracked by timely, accurate surveillance systems. Surveillance and treatment based on confirmed malaria cases will lead to better understanding of the disease burden and enable national malaria control programmes to direct better their resources to where they are most needed.     Therapeutic efficacy   Monitoring of therapeutic efficacy in falciparum malaria involves assessing clinical and parasitological outcomes of treatment for at least 28 days after the start of adequate treatment and monitoring for the reappearance of parasites in blood. The exact duration of post-treatment follow-up is based on the elimination half- life of the partner drug in the ACT being evaluated. Tools for monitoring antimalaria drug efficacy can be found on the\u00a0 WHO website\u00a0 [150]   .   PCR genotyping should be used in therapeutic monitoring of antimalarial drug efficacy against\u00a0 P. falciparum\u00a0 to distinguish between recrudescence (true treatment failure) and new infections.   An antimalarial medicine that is recommended in the national malaria treatment policy should be changed if the total treatment failure proportion is \u2265 10%, as assessed in vivo by monitoring therapeutic efficacy. A significantly declining trend in treatment efficacy over time, even if failure rates have not yet fallen to the \u2265 10% cut-off, should alert programmes to undertake more frequent monitoring and to prepare for a potential policy change.     Resistance   Antimalarial drug resistance is the ability of a parasite strain to survive and\/or multiply despite administration and absorption of an antimalarial drug given in doses equal to or higher than those usually recommended, provided that drug exposure is adequate. Resistance to antimalarial drugs arises because of selection of parasites with genetic changes (mutations or gene amplifications) that confer reduced susceptibility. Resistance has been documented to all classes of antimalarial medicines, including the artemisinin derivatives, and it is a major threat to malaria control.   Widespread inappropriate use of antimalarial drugs exerts a strong selective pressure on malaria parasites to develop high levels of resistance. Resistance can be prevented or its onset slowed considerably by combining antimalarial drugs with different mechanisms of action and ensuring high cure rates through full adherence to correct dose regimens. If different drugs with different mechanisms of resistance are used together, the emergence and spread of resistance should be slowed.   Clinical and parasitological assessment of therapeutic efficacy should include:    confirmation of the quality of the antimalarial medicines tested; \t molecular genotyping to distinguish between re-infections and recrudescence and to identify genetic markers of drug resistance; \t studies of parasite susceptibility to antimalarial drugs in culture; and \t measurement of antimalarial drug levels to assess exposure in cases of slow therapeutic response or treatment failure        Pharmacovigilance   Governments should have effective pharmacovigilance systems (such as the WHO pregnancy registry) to monitor the safety of all drugs, including antimalarial medicines. The safety profiles of the currently recommended antimalarial drugs are reasonably well described and supported by an evidence base of several thousand participants (mainly from clinical trials); however, rare but serious adverse drug reactions will not be detected in clinical trials of this size, particularly if they occur primarily in young children, pregnant women or people with concurrent\u00a0 illness,\u00a0who are usually under-represented in clinical trials.
